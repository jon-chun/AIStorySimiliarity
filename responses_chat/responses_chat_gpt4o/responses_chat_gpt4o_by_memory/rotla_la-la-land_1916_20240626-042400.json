    "character_score_explanation": "La La Land and Raiders of the Lost Ark both feature strong and charismatic protagonists (Mia and Sebastian vs. Indiana Jones) who are driven by their passions (acting/music vs. archaeology). However, the characters in La La Land are more focused on personal and romantic growth, while Raiders emphasizes adventure and conflict against antagonists. The supporting characters in both films play significant roles but with different dynamics and purposes.",

The narrative styles and plot structures of the two films differ significantly.",

    "setting_score_explanation": "La La Land is set in contemporary Los Angeles, using the city's modern and iconic locations to enhance its narrative of dreams and romance. Raiders of the Lost Ark, however, spans multiple exotic locations in the 1930s, including Peru, Nepal, and Egypt, which are integral to its adventurous and historical storyline. The settings in each film contribute differently to their respective themes and atmospheres.",
