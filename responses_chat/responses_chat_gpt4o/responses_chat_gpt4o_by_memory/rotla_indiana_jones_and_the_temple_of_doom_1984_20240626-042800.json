        "character_score_explanation": "Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom retains the iconic character of Indiana Jones, sharing similarities with Raiders of the Lost Ark in his traits as a rugged, intelligent archaeologist-adventurer. Supporting characters such as Short Round and Willie Scott, though different from those in Raiders, offer a similar dynamic of sidekick and love interest, enhancing the narrative with their unique contributions.",

        "plot_score_explanation": "Both Raiders of the Lost Ark and Temple of Doom follow Indiana Jones on an adventurous quest involving ancient artifacts with supernatural powers. The plot structures include elements of discovery, danger, and the fight against malevolent forces. Temple of Doom, however, introduces a darker tone and more exotic locations, differentiating it slightly from the original.",

        "setting_score_explanation": "Temple of Doom features diverse and exotic settings that play a crucial role in the narrative, much like Raiders of the Lost Ark. The film spans locations from Shanghai to India, presenting lush jungles and mysterious temples that enhance the adventurous atmosphere and are visually distinct from the locations in Raiders.",

        "theme_score_explanation": "Themes in Temple of Doom include the importance of historical artifacts, the conflict between good and evil, and the supernatural, mirroring Raiders of the Lost Ark. However, Temple of Doom places a stronger emphasis on darker, more mystical elements, such as human sacrifice and ancient curses, which provide a unique thematic flavor."
