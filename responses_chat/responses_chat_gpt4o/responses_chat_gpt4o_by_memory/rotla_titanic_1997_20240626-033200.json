    "character_score_explanation": "The characters in 'Raiders of the Lost Ark' and 'Titanic' differ significantly in their focus and development. Indiana Jones is an action-driven, adventurous archaeologist, while Jack and Rose are characters rooted in a dramatic romance. The primary motivation and narrative function of these characters lead to a low similarity score.",

    "plot_score_explanation": "The plot of 'Raiders of the Lost Ark' is centered on a fast-paced, action-filled adventure to recover an artifact, whereas 'Titanic' focuses on a romantic tragedy set against a historical disaster. The fundamental nature of the plots in both films is very different, leading to a low plot similarity score.",

    "setting_score_explanation": "Both films have historical settings, but 'Raiders of the Lost Ark' features diverse, exotic locations related to archaeology, while 'Titanic' is set on the RMS Titanic and explores early 20th-century social dynamics. The historical context provides some similarity, but the specific settings are quite different.",

    "theme_score_explanation": "While both 'Raiders of the Lost Ark' and 'Titanic' explore historical themes, the focus is different.
