    "character_score_explanation": "Lara Croft and Indiana Jones share similarities as adventurous archaeologists with a deep passion for uncovering historical artifacts. Both are driven by personal motivations and a strong sense of adventure. However, Lara Croft is more modern and technology-savvy, often relying on her physical prowess and gadgets, while Indiana Jones combines physicality with more traditional methods. The supporting characters in Lara Croft's story also play significant roles, but they are more focused on family and personal connections compared to Indy's broader range of allies and adversaries.",

    "plot_score_explanation": "Both plots center around the search for ancient artifacts, with the protagonists overcoming various physical and intellectual challenges. Raiders of the Lost Ark emphasizes action and the supernatural elements associated with the Ark of the Covenant, while the Lara Croft script involves a mix of high-stakes adventure and personal drama, focusing on the search for the mythical city of El Dorado. The balance between action sequences and intellectual puzzles is present in both, though Lara Croft's narrative includes more modern technological elements and personal vendettas.",

    "setting_score_explanation": "Raiders of the Lost Ark and Lara Croft both feature exotic and varied settings that enhance the adventurous tone. Raiders spans multiple countries and historical sites from the 1930s, creating a rich, pre-WWII atmosphere. Lara Croft's story, while also globally set, includes more modern and diverse locations such as boarding schools, jungles, and urban environments, reflecting a contemporary world. The historical period differences add unique flavors to each story, with Lara Croft’s settings incorporating more current geopolitical contexts.",

    "theme_score_explanation": "The themes in both films revolve around the preservation of history and the ethical responsibilities that come with uncovering powerful artifacts. Raiders of the Lost Ark explores themes of power, corruption, and the supernatural, highlighting the dangers of exploiting ancient relics. Lara Croft's narrative shares these elements but also emphasizes personal legacy and family ties. The modern themes in Lara Croft’s story, such as the use of technology and the protagonist’s personal growth, differentiate it from the more traditional, mythic themes in Raiders."
