    "character_score_explanation": "The characters in 'Raiders of the Lost Ark' and 'Office Space' differ significantly. Indiana Jones is a heroic, adventurous archaeologist, while the characters in 'Office Space' are primarily office workers dealing with mundane and comedic issues. The depth and nature of their motivations and interactions are not comparable.",
    "plot_score_explanation": "The plot of 'Raiders of the Lost Ark' is an action-packed adventure centered on the search for a powerful artifact, while 'Office Space' focuses on the everyday struggles of office workers and their rebellion against corporate drudgery. The stakes, pacing, and narrative styles are vastly different.",
    "setting_score_explanation": "The settings of 'Raiders of the Lost Ark' are exotic and varied, including locations like Peru, Nepal, and Egypt, enhancing its adventurous feel. 'Office Space,' on the other hand, is primarily set in a mundane office environment, which serves its comedic and satirical tone but lacks the adventurous and historical allure.",
    "theme_score_explanation": "Both films address the theme of rebelling against oppressive systems, but 'Raiders of the Lost Ark' does so through a lens of epic adventure and the fight against evil, while 'Office Space' uses humor and satire to critique corporate culture. The thematic execution in each film serves different narrative purposes and tones."
