    "character_score_explanation": "The Mummy and Raiders of the Lost Ark both feature charismatic and adventurous protagonists (Rick O'Connell and Indiana Jones) who are driven by their quests for historical artifacts. Both have strong-willed female leads (Evelyn Carnarvon and Marion Ravenwood) who are integral to the plot. However, Rick's character leans more towards the swashbuckling hero trope, while Indiana is portrayed as a more scholarly adventurer. The antagonists in both films are driven by similar desires for power and immortality, though Imhotep has a more personal vendetta than the Nazis in Raiders.",

The stakes in both movies are high, involving potential global consequences if the antagonists succeed.",
