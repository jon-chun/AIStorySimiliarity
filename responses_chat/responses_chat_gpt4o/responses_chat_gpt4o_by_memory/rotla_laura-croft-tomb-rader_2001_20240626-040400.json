    "character_score_explanation": "Lara Croft and Indiana Jones are both adventurous and resourceful archaeologists. Lara shares Indy’s charisma and determination but exhibits a modern, tech-savvy approach compared to Indy’s classic ruggedness. Supporting characters, including Lara’s parents, add depth, similar to the relationships in Raiders of the Lost Ark, though with different dynamics and stakes.",

    "plot_score_explanation": "Both narratives revolve around the pursuit of historical artifacts amidst dangerous adventures. Lara’s quest involves personal stakes and familial connections, whereas Raiders of the Lost Ark focuses more on global consequences and supernatural elements. The presence of rival treasure hunters and action-packed sequences provides a thematic link but with different story arcs.",

    "setting_score_explanation": "The settings in both films span various exotic and historically significant locations. Lara Croft’s story includes diverse global sites, but the narrative is more modern and incorporates high-tech elements. Raiders of the Lost Ark, set in the 1930s, emphasizes historical authenticity and archaeological sites, giving it a classic adventure feel.",

    "theme_score_explanation": "Themes of preserving history and the ethical implications of artifact retrieval are central in both films. Lara Croft’s narrative explores personal legacy and modern dangers, while Raiders of the Lost Ark delves into themes of power, corruption, and the supernatural. Both highlight the clash between personal gain and the greater good, though with different tones and resolutions."
