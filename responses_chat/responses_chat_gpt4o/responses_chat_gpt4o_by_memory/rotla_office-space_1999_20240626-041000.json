    "character_score_explanation": "The characters in Raiders of the Lost Ark are adventurous and heroic, while those in Office Space are regular office workers with mundane lives. The contrast between Indiana Jones and Peter Gibbons is stark, with one being a fearless archaeologist and the other a disillusioned employee.",

    "plot_score_explanation": "Raiders of the Lost Ark involves an adventurous quest to find a powerful artifact, filled with action and supernatural elements. Office Space revolves around office politics, job dissatisfaction, and a mundane heist. The plot structures are entirely different, with one focusing on high stakes and the other on everyday struggles.",

    "setting_score_explanation": "Raiders of the Lost Ark is set in exotic, historical locations like Egypt and Nepal, enhancing its adventurous tone. Office Space is set in a modern-day office and nearby mundane locations, which do not compare in terms of excitement or historical depth.",

    "theme_score_explanation": "The themes in Raiders of the Lost Ark include adventure, heroism, and the battle between good and evil. Office Space deals with modern work-life issues, disillusionment, and rebellion against corporate culture. The thematic focus of the two scripts is vastly different, with minimal overlap."
