    "character_score_explanation": "National Treasure and Raiders of the Lost Ark both feature a charismatic, adventurous protagonist (Ben Gates and Indiana Jones) who is deeply invested in historical artifacts. The supporting characters in both films play significant roles in aiding the protagonist. However, Indiana Jones is more rugged and action-oriented, while Ben Gates is more intellectual and relies on his knowledge of history and puzzles.",

    "plot_score_explanation": "Both films revolve around the quest for a significant historical artifact and involve a series of clues and adventures leading to the discovery. Raiders of the Lost Ark has a more intense and action-packed plot with supernatural elements, while National Treasure focuses more on intellectual challenges and historical puzzles with a modern twist.",

    "setting_score_explanation": "Raiders of the Lost Ark spans various exotic locations across different countries and historical periods, enhancing its adventurous tone. National Treasure, however, is primarily set in contemporary America, using familiar landmarks and historical sites, which creates a different kind of historical intrigue but lacks the global, historical diversity of Raiders.",

    "theme_score_explanation": "Both films emphasize the importance of history and the preservation of cultural artifacts. Raiders of the Lost Ark explores themes of power, corruption, and the supernatural, while National Treasure focuses on patriotism, the protection of national heritage, and uncovering hidden truths about national identity. The tone in Raiders is darker and more cautionary, whereas National Treasure is more optimistic and educational."
