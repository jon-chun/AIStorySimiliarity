    "character_score_explanation": "Office Space features a group of disillusioned office workers led by Peter Gibbons, while Raiders of the Lost Ark centers on the adventurous and resourceful archaeologist Indiana Jones. The characters in Office Space are focused on mundane, everyday frustrations, contrasting sharply with the heroic and larger-than-life personas in Raiders of the Lost Ark.",
    
    "plot_score_explanation": "Office Space follows the story of employees rebelling against their company's oppressive management, culminating in a heist of fractions of pennies. Raiders of the Lost Ark involves a high-stakes quest for a powerful artifact, with action-packed sequences and a clear antagonist. The plots are fundamentally different in scope, style, and intensity.",
    
    "setting_score_explanation": "Office Space is set in a contemporary corporate office environment, reflecting the everyday life of white-collar workers. In contrast, Raiders of the Lost Ark spans various exotic locations around the world, including jungles, deserts, and ancient temples, offering a much more adventurous and dynamic setting.",
    
    "theme_score_explanation": "The primary themes in Office Space revolve around corporate dissatisfaction, the monotony of office life, and personal freedom. Raiders of the Lost Ark explores themes of adventure, the conflict between good and evil, and the pursuit of knowledge. While both films touch on the desire for personal agency, their thematic explorations diverge significantly in context and tone."
