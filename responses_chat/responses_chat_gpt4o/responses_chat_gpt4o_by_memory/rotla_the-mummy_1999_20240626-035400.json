    "character_score_explanation": "Both Raiders of the Lost Ark and The Mummy feature charismatic, adventurous protagonists (Indiana Jones and Rick O'Connell) who are driven by a mix of personal motives and ethical responsibilities. The supporting characters in both films include strong female leads and loyal sidekicks. However, Indiana Jones is more academically inclined compared to Rick O'Connell, who is more of a soldier of fortune. The antagonists in both films are similarly motivated by greed and power but have different backgrounds and methods.",

    "plot_score_explanation": "The plots of both films revolve around the discovery and protection of ancient artifacts with supernatural powers, leading to a race against malevolent forces. While Raiders of the Lost Ark focuses more on the race to uncover the Ark and its subsequent protection, The Mummy emphasizes the resurrection of an ancient curse and the battle against its consequences. Both plots involve a series of clues, chases, and confrontations, but The Mummy has a more horror-oriented approach compared to the action-adventure style of Raiders.",

    "setting_score_explanation": "Both films are set in exotic locations that play crucial roles in their narratives. Raiders of the Lost Ark spans multiple countries, including Peru, Nepal, and Egypt, while The Mummy is primarily set in Egypt. The historical period settings enhance their adventurous tones, with Raiders set in the 1930s and The Mummy in the 1920s. The detailed depiction of ancient ruins and archaeological sites is more prominent in The Mummy, aligning closely with the settings in Raiders.",

    "theme_score_explanation": "Both films share themes of historical preservation, the power of ancient artifacts, and the ethical responsibilities of those who uncover them. Raiders of the Lost Ark explores the conflict between science and faith and the dangers of exploiting ancient artifacts. The Mummy, on the other hand, emphasizes the horror of resurrecting ancient curses and the battle against evil forces. While Raiders has a more philosophical and action-oriented tone, The Mummy leans towards horror and fantasy elements."
