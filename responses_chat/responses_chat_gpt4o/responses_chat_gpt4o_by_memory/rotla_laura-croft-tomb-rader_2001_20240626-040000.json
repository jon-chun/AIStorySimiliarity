    "character_score_explanation": "Both Raiders of the Lost Ark and Lara Croft: Tomb Raider feature strong, adventurous protagonists (Indiana Jones and Lara Croft) who are scholars and adventurers. Both characters are resourceful and determined, but Indiana Jones has a more rugged, down-to-earth persona, whereas Lara Croft embodies a more modern, tech-savvy adventurer. The supporting characters in both films play significant roles, but the emotional depth and complexity of relationships in Raiders are more pronounced compared to the more action-focused interactions in Tomb Raider.",

    "plot_score_explanation": "The plots of both films revolve around the protagonists racing to find and protect ancient artifacts, facing numerous physical challenges and rival treasure hunters. Raiders of the Lost Ark has a more coherent, tightly woven plot with a blend of action, mystery, and supernatural elements. In contrast, Lara Croft: Tomb Raider emphasizes action and spectacle, sometimes at the expense of narrative cohesion. The stakes in Raiders are tied to global consequences and mystical forces, whereas Tomb Raider focuses more on personal quests and technological aspects.",

    "setting_score_explanation": "Both films feature diverse and exotic settings that enhance the adventurous tone of the narratives. Raiders of the Lost Ark spans several countries, including Peru, Nepal, and Egypt, each location integral to the story and rich with historical context. Tomb Raider, while also spanning various global locations, focuses more on high-tech settings and modern environments. The historical authenticity and period setting of Raiders provide a more immersive experience compared to the contemporary, somewhat fantastical settings of Tomb Raider.",

    "theme_score_explanation": "The themes in Raiders of the Lost Ark revolve around the ethical responsibilities of archaeologists, the clash between good and evil, and the supernatural consequences of tampering with ancient artifacts. Lara Croft: Tomb Raider, on the other hand, explores themes of personal legacy, the pursuit of knowledge, and the use of advanced technology in archaeology. While both films emphasize the importance of preserving history, Raiders offers a deeper exploration of power, corruption, and faith, whereas Tomb Raider presents a more individualistic, modern interpretation of adventure and discovery."
