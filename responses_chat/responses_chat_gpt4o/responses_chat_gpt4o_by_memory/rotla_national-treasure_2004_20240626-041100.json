    "character_score_explanation": "Both Raiders of the Lost Ark and National Treasure feature charismatic and determined protagonists (Indiana Jones and Benjamin Gates) who are scholars and adventurers. They share a deep respect for history and are motivated by ethical reasons to pursue their quests. However, Indiana Jones relies more on physical prowess and combat skills, whereas Benjamin Gates is more cerebral, relying on intellect and puzzle-solving abilities. Supporting characters in both films are crucial but differ in emotional complexity and collaborative dynamics.",

    "plot_score_explanation": "The plots of Raiders of the Lost Ark and National Treasure revolve around uncovering and protecting historical artifacts, blending adventure with mystery and suspense. Both involve a series of clues and puzzles leading to their goals while evading rival treasure hunters. Raiders of the Lost Ark is more action-packed with numerous chases and confrontations, whereas National Treasure focuses more on intellectual challenges and historical riddles. The stakes in Raiders involve supernatural forces and world-altering consequences, whereas National Treasure emphasizes the protection of national heritage.",

    "setting_score_explanation": "Raiders of the Lost Ark spans multiple countries, including Peru, Nepal, and Egypt, with settings that enhance the adventurous tone. The historical period of the 1930s adds pre-World War II tension. In contrast, National Treasure is set in contemporary times, mainly in the United States, featuring American landmarks and historical sites. This modern setting creates a sense of national pride and historical intrigue. While Raiders emphasizes global historical exploration, National Treasure focuses on the rich historical tapestry within the U.S.",

    "theme_score_explanation": "Both films explore themes around the importance of history, preservation of knowledge, and ethical responsibilities. Raiders of the Lost Ark delves into power, corruption, and the supernatural, highlighting the dangers of exploiting artifacts. National Treasure shares the theme of historical preservation but emphasizes patriotism and uncovering hidden truths about national identity and heritage. The interplay between personal ambition and the greater good is common, but Raiders presents it with a darker, more cautionary perspective, whereas National Treasure frames it as a journey of discovery and enlightenment."
