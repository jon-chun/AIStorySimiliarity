    "character_score_explanation": "The script for Lara Croft: Tomb Raider and Raiders of the Lost Ark both feature strong, adventurous protagonists with a background in archaeology. Lara Croft is similar to Indiana Jones in her physical prowess and determination, but her character is more modern and lacks the rugged, classic hero charm of Indy. Supporting characters in both scripts play significant roles, but Indy's relationships are more complex and nuanced compared to Lara's more straightforward interactions.",

    "plot_score_explanation": "Both plots revolve around the discovery and protection of ancient artifacts, with a series of adventurous and perilous events. Raiders of the Lost Ark focuses on the supernatural and the epic struggle against Nazi antagonists, while Lara Croft: Tomb Raider leans more towards a mix of supernatural and modern tech-driven challenges. The stakes in both films are high, but Indy's quest has a more global and historical significance compared to Lara's more personal and localized adventures.",

    "setting_score_explanation": "Raiders of the Lost Ark spans multiple exotic locations across the globe, including Peru, Nepal, and Egypt, each adding to the film's adventurous and historical ambiance. Lara Croft: Tomb Raider also features diverse locations, such as London, the Himalayas, and Peru, but with a more modern twist. While both settings are richly detailed, Raiders emphasizes a historical and archeological journey, whereas Tomb Raider blends ancient and contemporary elements.",

    "theme_score_explanation": "The themes of both films center around the preservation of history and the ethical implications of uncovering ancient artifacts. Raiders of the Lost Ark delves into themes of power, corruption, and the supernatural, with a strong emphasis on the conflict between science and faith. Lara Croft: Tomb Raider shares the theme of historical preservation but with a more modern, action-oriented approach, lacking the deeper philosophical and ethical exploration found in Raiders."
