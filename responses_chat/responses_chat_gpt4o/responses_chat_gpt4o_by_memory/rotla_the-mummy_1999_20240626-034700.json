    "character_score_explanation": "Both The Mummy and Raiders of the Lost Ark feature adventurous protagonists (Rick O'Connell and Indiana Jones) who are courageous, resourceful, and skilled in combat. However, Rick's character is slightly more roguish and less scholarly compared to Indy's academic background. The supporting characters in both films include strong female leads and antagonists driven by power, yet the depth and complexity of relationships in Raiders give it a slight edge.",
    
    "plot_score_explanation": "The plots of The Mummy and Raiders of the Lost Ark revolve around the discovery and protection of ancient artifacts, with elements of supernatural horror and adventure. Both films involve a series of dangerous encounters, puzzles, and rival treasure hunters. However, The Mummy focuses more on resurrection and curses, while Raiders has a stronger emphasis on the battle against the Nazis and the quest for the Ark of the Covenant.",
    
    "setting_score_explanation": "Both films are set in exotic locations that play a crucial role in the narrative. Raiders of the Lost Ark spans multiple countries, including Peru, Nepal, and Egypt, with a historical backdrop of the 1930s.

The vivid depiction of ancient Egyptian culture in The Mummy adds to its setting's richness, comparable to the diverse locations in Raiders.",
