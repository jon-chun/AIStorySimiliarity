    "character_score_explanation": "The characters in Raiders of the Lost Ark are adventurous and dynamic, with strong, archetypal roles like Indiana Jones as the daring hero. In Office Space, the characters are more mundane and satirical, focusing on everyday office workers. The primary similarity lies in the clear protagonist and antagonist roles, but the character types and their motivations differ significantly.",

    "plot_score_explanation": "The plot of Raiders of the Lost Ark centers on a high-stakes adventure to recover a powerful artifact, filled with action and historical intrigue. Office Space, on the other hand, revolves around office workers rebelling against their mundane corporate life and plotting a heist. The overall narrative structures are vastly different, with only a slight overlap in the element of a quest or goal.",

    "setting_score_explanation": "Raiders of the Lost Ark is set in exotic, historical locations around the world, enhancing its adventurous and epic feel. Office Space is set in a modern, everyday office environment, focusing on the mundane aspects of corporate life. The settings are nearly opposite in terms of tone and atmosphere.",

    "theme_score_explanation": "Both films explore themes of rebellion and challenging authority, but Raiders of the Lost Ark deals with grand themes of good versus evil and the supernatural, while Office Space focuses on the satire of corporate culture and the pursuit of personal happiness. The thematic overlap is minimal, mainly around the idea of challenging the status quo."
