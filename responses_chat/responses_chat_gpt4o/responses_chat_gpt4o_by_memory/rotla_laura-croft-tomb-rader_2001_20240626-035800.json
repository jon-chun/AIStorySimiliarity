    "character_score_explanation": "Both Lara Croft and Indiana Jones are iconic adventurers with a deep knowledge of archaeology and history. While Lara's character is more modern and emphasizes physical agility and technology, Indy's character combines intellectual and physical prowess with a more rugged charm. The supporting characters in Lara's story, such as her parents and Karak, provide a rich background similar to Indy's interactions with Marcus Brody and Marion Ravenwood, though with a more personal and familial twist.",

    "plot_score_explanation": "The plot of 'Lara Croft: Tomb Raider' involves a high-stakes treasure hunt with ancient artifacts and booby traps, much like 'Raiders of the Lost Ark.' Both stories include a protagonist racing against a powerful antagonist to uncover and protect historical treasures. However, Lara's quest has a more personal element, driven by her family's legacy, whereas Indy's adventure is more about stopping a global threat posed by the Nazis.",

    "setting_score_explanation": "Both films feature exotic and diverse settings that are integral to their adventurous narratives. 'Lara Croft: Tomb Raider' includes locations such as ancient tombs, the Himalayas, and South America, mirroring the globe-trotting nature of 'Raiders of the Lost Ark,' which spans places like Peru, Nepal, and Egypt. The modern settings in Lara's story, like her boarding school and the Croft estate, add a contemporary layer that differs from the 1930s backdrop of Indy's adventures.",

    "theme_score_explanation": "The themes of both films revolve around the importance of history and the ethical responsibilities of preserving knowledge. 'Raiders of the Lost Ark' explores themes of power, corruption, and the supernatural, emphasizing the dangers of exploiting ancient artifacts. 'Lara Croft: Tomb Raider' shares similar themes but focuses more on personal legacy, adventure, and the intersection of modern technology with ancient mysteries, making it more about personal discovery and empowerment."
