    "character_score_explanation": "Both films feature treasure-hunting protagonists (Ben Gates and Indiana Jones) who are scholars/adventurers, but Indy is more rugged and action-oriented while Ben relies more on intellect. The supporting characters and antagonists have some similarities in motivation, but Indy's relationships are generally more complex.",

    "plot_score_explanation": "Both plots involve racing to uncover historical artifacts while evading rivals, with puzzles and clues leading the way. However, National Treasure is more focused on American history and modern-day settings, while Raiders has a more global, period adventure feel with higher supernatural stakes. National Treasure's plot is more heist/mystery oriented.",

    "setting_score_explanation": "Both feature diverse, history-rich settings that are integral to the plot. However, Raiders spans multiple countries and time periods for a more exotic adventure feel, while National Treasure focuses on American historical sites and landmarks in a contemporary setting. National Treasure's use of modern urban locations and technology contrasts with Raiders' period setting.",

    "theme_score_explanation": "Both explore themes of historical preservation and the ethical use of artifacts. However, Raiders delves more into supernatural/religious themes and the dangers of exploiting powerful relics. National Treasure has a stronger focus on patriotism, American heritage, and uncovering hidden national truths. Both touch on personal ambition vs greater good, but with different tones and perspectives."
