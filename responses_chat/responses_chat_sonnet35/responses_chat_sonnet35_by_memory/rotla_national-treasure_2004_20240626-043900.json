    "character_score_explanation": "Both feature scholarly treasure hunters as protagonists, but Ben Gates lacks Indiana Jones' ruggedness and action hero qualities. The supporting characters and villains are less developed compared to Raiders. Ben's relationship with Abigail is reminiscent of Indy and Marion, but less central to the story.",

    "plot_score_explanation": "The overall plot structure of a race to find a legendary artifact before the villains is very similar. Both involve decoding clues and exploring historical sites. National Treasure has more of a heist/caper feel at times. The climactic confrontation with the villains in an ancient chamber is quite similar to Raiders' ending.",

    "setting_score_explanation": "Both feature globe-trotting adventures to historical locations, though National Treasure focuses more on American historical sites rather than exotic foreign locales. The underground chambers and booby-trapped ancient sites are very reminiscent of Raiders. The modern-day setting of National Treasure differentiates it somewhat.",

    "theme_score_explanation": "Both explore themes of history, artifacts, and keeping powerful relics out of the wrong hands. National Treasure has a stronger focus on American history and patriotism. Raiders has more supernatural/religious themes. Both touch on academic vs. adventure approaches to archaeology/history."
