    "character_score_explanation": "Both films feature adventurous archaeologists as protagonists, with similar supporting casts including a love interest and comic relief sidekick.

    "plot_score_explanation": "Both plots involve a race against evil forces to find an ancient artifact with supernatural powers. They share similar structures with globe-trotting adventures, puzzles to solve, and climactic confrontations with unleashed ancient forces. The Mummy has a stronger horror element but follows a very similar overall plot arc.",
    
    "setting_score_explanation": "Both films are primarily set in Egypt and feature extensive scenes in ancient ruins and archaeological sites. They share a 1920s-30s time period that evokes a romanticized era of exploration. The Mummy expands on the Egyptian setting with more locations and supernatural elements, but the core setting is extremely similar.",
    
    "theme_score_explanation": "The films share themes of respecting ancient power, the dangers of greed, and conflicts between science and the supernatural.
