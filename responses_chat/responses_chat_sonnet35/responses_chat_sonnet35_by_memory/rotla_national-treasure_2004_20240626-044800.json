    "character_score_explanation": "The protagonists Ben Gates and Indiana Jones share some similarities as scholarly adventurers seeking historical artifacts, but Ben is less action-oriented and more intellectually-focused. The supporting characters and villains have some parallels but are less developed in National Treasure.",

    "plot_score_explanation": "Both films involve a race to find a historical treasure, with puzzles and clues leading the way. National Treasure has more emphasis on American history and modern settings/technology, while Raiders has more action sequences and supernatural elements. The basic treasure hunt plot structure is quite similar.",

    "setting_score_explanation": "While Raiders spans exotic international locations, National Treasure focuses on American historical sites and cities. Both feature underground chambers, booby traps, and historical locations tied to ancient secrets. The modern-day setting of National Treasure differentiates it somewhat from Raiders' 1930s period setting.",

    "theme_score_explanation": "Both films explore themes of historical preservation, the power of artifacts, and academic pursuits vs adventure. National Treasure has a stronger focus on American patriotism and founding principles. Raiders deals more with religious/supernatural power and good vs evil on a global scale. But both emphasize the importance of keeping powerful artifacts out of the wrong hands."
