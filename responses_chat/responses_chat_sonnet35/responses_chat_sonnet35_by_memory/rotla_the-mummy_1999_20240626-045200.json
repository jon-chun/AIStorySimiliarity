    "character_score_explanation": "Both films feature adventurous archaeologists as protagonists, with strong-willed female leads and comic relief sidekicks. The villains are similarly motivated by supernatural power. However, O'Connell is more of an action hero than the scholarly Indiana Jones.",

    "plot_score_explanation": "Both plots involve a race against evil forces to find an ancient artifact with supernatural powers. They share similar story beats: desert adventures, ancient traps, and climactic confrontations with unleashed supernatural forces. The Mummy has a more horror-focused tone in its latter half.",
    
    "setting_score_explanation": "Both films are set primarily in Egypt and feature extensive scenes in ancient ruins and tombs. They share a 1920s-1930s time period and pulp adventure aesthetic. The Mummy expands on the Egyptian setting with more supernatural elements but lacks Raiders' globe-trotting variety.",
    
    "theme_score_explanation": "Both explore themes of respecting ancient cultures and the dangers of exploiting powerful artifacts. The Mummy leans more heavily into themes of resurrection and curse, while Raiders has a stronger focus on religious artifacts and faith versus skepticism."
