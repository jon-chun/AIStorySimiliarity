    "character_score_explanation": "The characters in National Treasure share some similarities with Raiders of the Lost Ark, particularly the adventurous and knowledgeable protagonist (Ben Gates vs. Indiana Jones). However, Ben is more cerebral and less action-oriented than Indy. The supporting characters and villains are less well-developed in National Treasure compared to Raiders.",

    "plot_score_explanation": "Both films feature a treasure hunt plot with historical mysteries, clues, and racing against villains. National Treasure has more of a heist element with stealing the Declaration of Independence. The pacing and structure are similar, though Raiders has more action set pieces while National Treasure focuses more on puzzles and American history.",

    "setting_score_explanation": "National Treasure prominently features American historical sites and landmarks, creating a strong sense of place tied to US history. This differs from Raiders' more global, exotic locales. However, both films use their settings to create a sense of adventure and historical intrigue. National Treasure's modern setting allows for technology use that wasn't present in Raiders.",

    "theme_score_explanation": "Both films explore themes of historical preservation, the value of artifacts, and the conflict between academic pursuit and adventure. National Treasure has a stronger focus on patriotism and American history. Raiders deals more with spiritual/supernatural elements and the abuse of power, while National Treasure emphasizes solving puzzles and uncovering hidden knowledge about the nation's founders."
