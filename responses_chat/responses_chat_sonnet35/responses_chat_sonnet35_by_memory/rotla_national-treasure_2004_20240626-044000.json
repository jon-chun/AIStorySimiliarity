    "character_score_explanation": "Both films feature scholar-adventurers as protagonists (Ben Gates and Indiana Jones) who pursue historical artifacts. However, Ben Gates is more cerebral and less action-oriented than Indiana Jones. The supporting characters and villains are less developed in National Treasure compared to the complex characters in Raiders.",

    "plot_score_explanation": "Both plots involve a race to find a legendary treasure/artifact before villains can obtain it. They share elements like decoding clues, exploring historical sites, and action sequences. However, National Treasure focuses more on puzzle-solving and American history, while Raiders has more globe-trotting adventure and supernatural elements.",
    
    "setting_score_explanation": "Both films feature various historical locations and artifacts as key settings. National Treasure focuses heavily on American historical sites and symbols, while Raiders spans more exotic international locations. Both depict ancient tombs/chambers as climactic settings. The modern-day setting of National Treasure differs from Raiders' 1930s period setting.",
    
    "theme_score_explanation": "Both films explore themes of historical preservation, the ethics of artifact recovery, and personal ambition vs. greater good. National Treasure has a stronger focus on patriotism and American heritage. Raiders deals more with religious/supernatural power and good vs. evil on a grander scale. Both valorize historical knowledge and discovery."
