Let me think through this step-by-step:

1. First, I'll identify key features to compare:
   - Character beliefs and motivations
   - Social dynamics and relationships
   - Story arc and plot structure
   - Setting and atmosphere

2. Now I'll evaluate each feature:

Character beliefs and motivations:
Both protagonists are driven adventurers seeking ancient artifacts. They face similar internal conflicts about trust and relationships. Score: 85/100

Social dynamics and relationships:
Both stories feature complex relationships with mentors, love interests, and antagonists. The dynamics are quite similar. Score: 80/100

Story arc and plot structure:
Both follow a classic adventure structure with quests, obstacles, and climactic confrontations. Very similar overall arcs. Score: 90/100

Setting and atmosphere:
While both feature exotic locations and ancient ruins, the specific settings differ significantly. Score: 70/100

3. Calculating overall similarity:
(85 + 80 + 90 + 70) / 4 = 81.25

Now I'll format this as JSON using the template:

    "similarity_overall": 81,
    "feature_1": {
        "value": 85,
        "description": "Character beliefs and motivations",
