Let me think through this step-by-step:

1. First, I'll identify key features to compare:
   - Character arcs
   - Plot structure
   - Themes
   - Setting and atmosphere
   - Action sequences

2. Now I'll evaluate each feature:

Character arcs:
Both films feature strong, capable female protagonists (Lara Croft and Indiana Jones) on archaeological adventures. They have similar backstories involving lost parents. However, Lara's arc focuses more on personal growth.
Similarity: 80/100

Plot structure:
Both follow a treasure hunt structure with betrayals, ancient traps, and racing against villains. However, Raiders has a more straightforward plot while Tomb Raider has more complex motivations and twists.
Similarity: 70/100

Themes:
Both explore themes of legacy, the ethics of archaeology, and confronting the past. Tomb Raider delves deeper into personal demons and the dangers of advanced technology.
Similarity: 65/100

Setting and atmosphere:
Both feature exotic locations and ancient ruins. However, Tomb Raider has a more modern, high-tech edge compared to Raiders' 1930s period setting.
Similarity: 60/100

Action sequences:
Both films showcase elaborate action set pieces involving ancient traps and chases. Tomb Raider's action has a more acrobatic, video game-inspired style.
Similarity: 75/100

3. Now I'll create the JSON structure based on these evaluations:
