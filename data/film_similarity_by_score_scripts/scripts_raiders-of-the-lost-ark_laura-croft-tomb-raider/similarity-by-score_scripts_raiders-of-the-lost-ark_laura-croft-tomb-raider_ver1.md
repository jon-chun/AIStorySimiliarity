Let me analyze these two scripts step-by-step to estimate their similarity:

1. Protagonists: Both feature strong, capable female protagonists (Lara Croft and Indiana Jones) who are adventurers/archaeologists. This is a key similarity.

2. Setting: Both involve globe-trotting adventures to exotic locations in search of ancient artifacts. Very similar.

3. Plot structure: Both follow a treasure hunt format with multiple action sequences and narrow escapes. Quite similar.

4. Antagonists: Both feature ruthless villains seeking artifacts for nefarious purposes. Similar.

5. Supporting characters: Both have mentor figures and allies that assist the protagonist. Somewhat similar.

6. Time period: Indiana Jones is set in the 1930s while Lara Croft is contemporary. Different.

7. Character backstory: Lara has a more developed backstory involving her parents' deaths. Indiana's past is less explored. Somewhat different.

8. Tone: Indiana Jones has more humor and a lighter tone overall compared to the more serious Tomb Raider. Somewhat different.

9. Action style: While both feature elaborate action sequences, Lara's are more acrobatic and technology-driven compared to Indy's. Somewhat different.

10. Supernatural elements: Both involve mystical artifacts, but Indiana Jones leans more heavily into supernatural occurrences. Somewhat different.

Based on this analysis, I'll now provide a similarity score using the requested JSON format:
