### Feature Analysis

#### Feature 1: Beliefs
- **Value**: 70
- **Description**: Core ideologies and convictions held by the characters.
- **Reasoning**: Both films center on the pursuit of significant religious artifacts (the Holy Grail and the Ark of the Covenant), reflecting a shared belief in the profound historical and supernatural importance of these objects. The protagonists and antagonists alike are driven by a blend of scientific curiosity and religious reverence, though the specifics differ. In "Raiders of the Lost Ark," the emphasis is more on the power of the artifact itself, while "The Last Crusade" also explores themes of faith and familial legacy【8:0†source】【8:1†source】.

#### Feature 2: Motivations
- **Value**: 80
- **Description**: The driving forces behind the characters' actions.
- **Reasoning**: The primary motivation for Indiana Jones in both films is the pursuit of these artifacts, driven by both professional curiosity as an archaeologist and personal stakes. In "Raiders of the Lost Ark," the motivation includes stopping the Nazis from obtaining a powerful weapon, while "The Last Crusade" adds the personal dimension of rescuing his father and continuing his father's lifelong quest. The villains in both films are similarly motivated by the desire for power and eternal life【8:5†source】【8:7†source】.

#### Feature 3: Social Dynamics
- **Value**: 60
- **Description**: The relationships and interactions among the characters.
- **Reasoning**: The social dynamics in both films involve a mix of alliances and betrayals. Indiana Jones teams up with various characters, including former lovers and new allies. The father-son relationship in "The Last Crusade" adds a deeper emotional layer compared to "Raiders of the Lost Ark." However, both films depict similar dynamics of camaraderie and conflict among the characters【8:11†source】【8:12†source】.

#### Feature 4: Narrative Arc
- **Value**: 75
- **Description**: The overall storyline progression, including the climax and resolution.
- **Reasoning**: Both films follow a classic adventure narrative arc with a quest for a powerful artifact, facing numerous challenges, and culminating in a dramatic climax. While "Raiders of the Lost Ark" focuses on the suspense and action of retrieving the Ark, "The Last Crusade" incorporates more elements of personal growth and discovery, particularly through the relationship between Indiana Jones and his father. Both films end with a resolution that sees the artifact lost or out of reach, preserving its mystery and power【8:10†source】【8:13†source】.
