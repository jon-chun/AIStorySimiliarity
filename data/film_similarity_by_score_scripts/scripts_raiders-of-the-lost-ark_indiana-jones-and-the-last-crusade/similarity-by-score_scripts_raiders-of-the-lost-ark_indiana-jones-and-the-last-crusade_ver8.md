To estimate the similarity score between the narratives of "Raiders of the Lost Ark" and "Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade," I'll consider the following features: beliefs, motivations, social dynamics, and arc. I'll assess each feature based on their importance in the narratives and provide an overall similarity score.

### Beliefs
Both films revolve around the central belief in the existence of powerful ancient artifacts. In "Raiders of the Lost Ark," the focus is on the Ark of the Covenant, while "The Last Crusade" centers on the Holy Grail. Both artifacts are believed to possess extraordinary powers, driving the characters to seek them out.

### Motivations
Indiana Jones' motivations in both films are primarily driven by a mix of professional interest as an archaeologist and personal stakes. In "Raiders of the Lost Ark," his motivation is to prevent the Nazis from acquiring the Ark, which could lead to disastrous consequences. In "The Last Crusade," his motivation is twofold: to find the Holy Grail and to rescue his father. The dual motivations of preserving historical artifacts and personal stakes are strong in both narratives.

### Social Dynamics
The social dynamics involve Indiana Jones interacting with various allies and antagonists. In "Raiders of the Lost Ark," he teams up with Marion Ravenwood and confronts the antagonist, Ren√© Belloq, along with Nazi forces. In "The Last Crusade," he partners with his father, Henry Jones Sr., and faces off against the antagonist, Walter Donovan, along with Nazi forces. The father-son dynamic adds a layer of depth to the social dynamics in "The Last Crusade."

### Arc
Both films follow a similar narrative arc, where Indiana Jones embarks on a quest to find an ancient artifact, faces numerous challenges, and ultimately succeeds in preventing the artifact from falling into the wrong hands. The hero's journey, involving departure, initiation, and return, is evident in both narratives.
