To estimate an overall similarity score between "Raiders of the Lost Ark" (1981) and "Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull" (2008), I'll use a rubric with four weighted features: beliefs, motivations, social dynamics, and narrative arc. Each feature will be evaluated individually, and then an overall similarity score will be derived.

### Similarity Analysis Rubric:

1. **Beliefs**: The core ideologies and values driving the protagonists and antagonists.
2. **Motivations**: The primary goals and reasons behind the characters' actions.
3. **Social Dynamics**: The relationships and interactions among characters.
4. **Arc**: The overall structure and progression of the narrative, including key plot points and resolutions.

### Feature Evaluations:

#### Feature 1: Beliefs
- **Description**: The protagonists, Indiana Jones in both films, exhibit a strong belief in the importance of archaeology, history, and the pursuit of knowledge. The antagonists in both films also share similar beliefs in the power of the supernatural artifacts they seek.
- **Value**: 85
- **Reasoning**: Both films center around the pursuit of ancient artifacts believed to hold immense power. The belief in these artifacts' significance is a central theme in both narratives.

#### Feature 2: Motivations
- **Description**: The motivations of the characters revolve around the retrieval and protection (or exploitation) of powerful artifacts. Indiana Jones aims to secure these artifacts to prevent them from falling into the wrong hands, while the antagonists seek to use them for power.
- **Value**: 90
- **Reasoning**: Indiana Jones' motivation to protect and preserve history is consistent across both films, as is the antagonists' desire for power through the supernatural.

#### Feature 3: Social Dynamics
- **Description**: The dynamics between Indiana Jones and his companions, as well as his adversaries, are crucial. Both films feature a blend of alliances and betrayals, with complex relationships developing throughout the narrative.
- **Value**: 75
- **Reasoning**: While the relationships and interactions are central in both films, the specific characters and their dynamics vary, affecting the overall similarity.

#### Feature 4: Arc
- **Description**: Both films follow a similar narrative arc, beginning with a discovery, followed by a series of adventures and obstacles, culminating in a climactic confrontation and resolution.
- **Value**: 80
- **Reasoning**: The narrative structure of discovery, adventure, and climax is a shared characteristic, though the specific details and settings differ.

### Final Similarity Score Calculation:
The final similarity score is derived from the weighted average of the individual feature scores.
