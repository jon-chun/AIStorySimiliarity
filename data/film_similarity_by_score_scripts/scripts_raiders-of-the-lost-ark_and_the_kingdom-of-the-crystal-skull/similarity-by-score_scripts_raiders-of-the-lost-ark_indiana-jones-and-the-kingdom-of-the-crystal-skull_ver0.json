        "reasoning": "Indiana Jones' motivation in both narratives is rooted in his archeological pursuits and the desire to prevent powerful artifacts from falling into the wrong hands. In 'Raiders of the Lost Ark,' he aims to secure the Ark to prevent the Nazis from using its power.

        "description": "The narrative arc follows a similar trajectory of discovery, conflict, and resolution.",
        "reasoning": "Both films follow a classic adventure arc where Indiana Jones embarks on a quest, faces numerous challenges, confronts the main antagonists, and ultimately resolves the conflict surrounding the artifact. In 'Raiders of the Lost Ark,' the arc concludes with the Ark's power defeating the Nazis, while in 'Kingdom of the Crystal Skull,' the skull's power results in the demise of the Soviet antagonist. The structural similarity in the journey and resolution contributes to a higher similarity score."
