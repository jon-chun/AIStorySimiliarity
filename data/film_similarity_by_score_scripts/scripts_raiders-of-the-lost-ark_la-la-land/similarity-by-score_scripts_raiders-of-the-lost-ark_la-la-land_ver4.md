Thank you for providing those film scripts. I'll carefully analyze them and provide a similarity score based on key narrative features, without reproducing any copyrighted material. Here is my assessment:

{
    "similarity_overall": 78,
    "feature_1": {
        "value": 90,
        "description": "Protagonists pursuing artistic dreams in Los Angeles",
        "reasoning": "Both stories center on young artists (an actress and a jazz musician) striving to achieve their creative ambitions in LA, facing setbacks and challenges along the way."
    },
    "feature_2": {
        "value": 85,
        "description": "Romance between artistic dreamers",
        "reasoning": "The central relationship in both films is between two artistic, ambitious characters pursuing their dreams. Their romance is complicated by career choices and opportunities."
    },
    "feature_3": {
        "value": 70,
        "description": "Bittersweet endings exploring paths not taken",
        "reasoning": "Both films conclude with the protagonists achieving some success, but at the cost of their relationship. They reflect on what might have been if different choices were made."
    },
    "feature_4": {
        "value": 65,
        "description": "Los Angeles as a backdrop for dreams and disillusionment",
        "reasoning": "The city of Los Angeles plays a significant role in both narratives, serving as both an inspiration for the characters' dreams and a source of challenges and disappointments."
