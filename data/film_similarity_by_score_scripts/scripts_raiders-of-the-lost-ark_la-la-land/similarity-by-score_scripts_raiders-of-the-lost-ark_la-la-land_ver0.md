Thank you for providing those two film scripts. I'll analyze their similarities carefully and provide a similarity score based on key narrative features. Here is my analysis in the requested JSON format:

{
    "similarity_overall": 78,
    "feature_1": {
        "value": 85,
        "description": "Protagonist's artistic aspirations and journey",
        "reasoning": "Both scripts feature protagonists pursuing artistic dreams in Los Angeles - acting for Mia in La La Land, archaeology/adventure for Indy in Raiders. Their journeys involve setbacks, self-doubt, and ultimately some form of success."
    },
    "feature_2": {
        "value": 70,
        "description": "Romance subplot and relationship dynamics", 
        "reasoning": "Both films incorporate romance as a key subplot, with the protagonists navigating relationships alongside their career ambitions. However, the centrality and outcome of the romances differ significantly between the two stories."
    },
    "feature_3": {
        "value": 80,
        "description": "Thematic focus on passion vs practicality",
        "reasoning": "The scripts explore themes of pursuing one's passion versus practical concerns. Indy balances academic work with adventuring, while Sebastian in La La Land wrestles with artistic integrity vs commercial success in music."
    },
    "feature_4": {
        "value": 75,
        "description": "Nostalgic/romanticized view of the past",
        "reasoning": "Both films incorporate nostalgic elements - La La Land's stylized Old Hollywood musical moments, and Raiders' pulp adventure throwbacks. They romanticize certain historical aesthetics while telling contemporary stories."
