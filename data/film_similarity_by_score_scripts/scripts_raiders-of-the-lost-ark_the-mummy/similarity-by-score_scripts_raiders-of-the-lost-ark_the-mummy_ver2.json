        "description": "Both films revolve around a central belief in ancient artifacts with supernatural powers.",
        "reasoning": "The Mummy involves belief in the power of the Book of the Dead and ancient curses, while Raiders of the Lost Ark centers on the Ark of the Covenant and its divine powers.

        "description": "The primary motivations for both protagonists are driven by adventure and the pursuit of historical artifacts.",
        "reasoning": "Indiana Jones is motivated by the academic and historical significance of the Ark, as well as personal rivalries. In The Mummy, Rick O'Connell's motivations also include adventure, but are more deeply intertwined with personal stakes and relationships, particularly with Evelyn. Both scripts emphasize the adventurous spirit and the high stakes involved in their quests."
