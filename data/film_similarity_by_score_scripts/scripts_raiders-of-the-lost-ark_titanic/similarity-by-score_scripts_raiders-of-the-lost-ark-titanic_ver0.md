To estimate the similarity between the narratives of "Titanic" (1997) and "Raiders of the Lost Ark" (1981), I will assess and score based on a set of narrative features. I will consider the following features: beliefs, motivations, social dynamics, and narrative arc. Here's the step-by-step analysis:

### Feature 1: Beliefs
**Value: 30**

**Description:** This feature evaluates the core beliefs and values that drive the main characters and the overarching themes of the films.

**Reasoning:** In "Titanic," the core beliefs revolve around love, sacrifice, and the clash between social classes. In "Raiders of the Lost Ark," the primary beliefs are centered on adventure, the pursuit of knowledge, and good versus evil. While both films contain strong character motivations driven by their beliefs, the thematic elements differ significantly. "Titanic" focuses on personal and emotional development, whereas "Raiders" emphasizes adventure and moral conflict.

### Feature 2: Motivations
**Value: 40**

**Description:** This feature assesses the motivations driving the main characters' actions throughout the story.

**Reasoning:** The motivations in "Titanic" are primarily driven by romantic and social aspirations. Jack and Rose’s actions are fueled by their desire to break free from societal constraints and find love. In "Raiders of the Lost Ark," Indiana Jones is motivated by his pursuit of archaeological treasures and the desire to prevent powerful artifacts from falling into the wrong hands. While both films feature strong, clear motivations, they operate in very different narrative contexts—romance versus adventure—leading to moderate similarity.

### Feature 3: Social Dynamics
**Value: 50**

**Description:** This feature examines the interactions and relationships between characters and their social environments.

**Reasoning:** In "Titanic," the social dynamics are heavily influenced by class differences and romantic relationships. The interactions between characters are deeply tied to the societal structure aboard the ship. "Raiders of the Lost Ark" also features complex social dynamics but is more focused on professional relationships and adversarial encounters. The dynamics between Indiana Jones, his allies, and his enemies are central to the plot. The difference in focus (romantic and class-related versus professional and adversarial) results in a moderate similarity score.

### Feature 4: Narrative Arc
**Value: 25**

**Description:** This feature looks at the overall structure and progression of the narrative.

**Reasoning:** "Titanic" follows a tragic romance narrative arc, culminating in the sinking of the ship and the personal losses of the characters. The structure is linear and focused on character development and emotional impact. "Raiders of the Lost Ark" follows a classic adventure narrative arc with a series of escalating challenges leading to a climactic confrontation and resolution. The structural and thematic differences in how each story is told are significant, resulting in a lower similarity score.
