Let's think through this step-by-step:

1. First, I'll identify key features to compare:
   - Plot structure (quest for ancient artifact)
   - Character dynamics (protagonist, love interest, antagonists)
   - Setting and time period
   - Action sequences and pacing
   - Themes (history, spirituality, danger of unchecked power)

2. Now, I'll assess each feature:

   Plot structure: 
   Both films center on a quest for a powerful ancient artifact (Ark of the Covenant vs. Declaration of Independence with hidden map). Very similar structure.
   Score: 90/100

   Character dynamics:
   Both feature an academic adventurer protagonist, a strong-willed female companion, and rival treasure hunters. Quite similar, though some differences in details.
   Score: 85/100

   Setting and time period:
   "Raiders" is set in 1936, while "National Treasure" is contemporary. However, both involve globe-trotting adventures and historical sites.
   Score: 70/100

   Action sequences and pacing:
   Both feature elaborate chases, fights, and puzzle-solving. "Raiders" is more violent, but pacing is similarly brisk in both.
   Score: 80/100

   Themes:
   Both explore historical mysteries, the power of artifacts, and the danger of them falling into the wrong hands. "National Treasure" has a stronger patriotic element.
   Score: 75/100

3. Calculating overall similarity:
   (90 + 85 + 70 + 80 + 75) / 5 = 80

Now, I'll format this assessment into the requested JSON structure:
