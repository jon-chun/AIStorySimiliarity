Indiana Jones works with colleagues and faces betrayal, while Benjamin Gates collaborates with friends and faces opposition from a former ally.

        "reasoning": "Both films follow a classic adventure arc, with the protagonists undergoing significant personal growth and facing escalating challenges. Indiana Jones transitions from a skeptical archaeologist to a believer in the supernatural power of the Ark. Benjamin Gates evolves from a treasure hunter to a hero who validates his familyâ€™s legacy. While their arcs are similar, the tone and specific challenges differ, with 'Raiders of the Lost Ark' having a darker, more suspenseful progression compared to the lighter, puzzle-driven narrative of 'National Treasure.'"
