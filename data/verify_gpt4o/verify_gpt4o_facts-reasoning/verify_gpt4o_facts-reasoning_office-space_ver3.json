    ],
    "reasoning_errors": "The comparisons between 'Raiders of the Lost Ark' and 'Office Space' show significant inaccuracies in both factual details and reasoning. The character comparison overlooks the fundamental differences in their roles and motivations. Indiana Jones is an adventurous archaeologist, while Peter Gibbons is a disillusioned office worker, making their character arcs and social dynamics starkly different. The plot comparison incorrectly aligns the structure of a corporate satire with an action-adventure film, missing the nuances of each genre. Setting comparisons fail to account for the entirely different contexts, one being a historical adventure, the other a contemporary corporate environment. Themes are also mismatched, as 'Raiders' focuses on the pursuit of ancient artifacts and good versus evil, whereas 'Office Space' critiques corporate monotony and personal fulfillment. These errors reduce the accuracy of the similarity scores significantly."
