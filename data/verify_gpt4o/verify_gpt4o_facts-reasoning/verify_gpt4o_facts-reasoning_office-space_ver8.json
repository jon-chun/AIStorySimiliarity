        "Office Space's protagonist is Peter Gibbons, not Indiana Jones.",
        "Office Space is set in the late 1990s, not the 1930s.",
        "Office Space does not involve adventure or artifact hunting.",
        "Raiders of the Lost Ark is centered on supernatural artifacts, not corporate satire.",
        "Peter's role is an office worker, not an archaeologist."
    ],
    "reasoning_errors": "The similarity scores for the characters, setting, and themes between Raiders of the Lost Ark and Office Space seem to be overestimated due to the fundamental differences in genre and narrative focus. Raiders of the Lost Ark is an action-adventure film with a strong emphasis on historical artifacts, global locations, and a battle against evil forces. In contrast, Office Space is a comedy that critiques corporate culture and focuses on the mundane life of office workers. The characters' motivations, roles, and psychological profiles differ significantly, as does the overall plot structure, which lacks the high-stakes adventure and supernatural elements present in Raiders of the Lost Ark. Themes of power, greed, and historical preservation in Raiders do not align well with the themes of individuality, rebellion against corporate monotony, and personal fulfillment found in Office Space."
