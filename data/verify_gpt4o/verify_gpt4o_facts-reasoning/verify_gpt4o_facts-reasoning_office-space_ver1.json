        "Indiana Jones is not primarily defined by struggles with authority",

    ],
    "reasoning_errors": "The analysis correctly identifies some character similarities, such as disillusionment and motivation, but overstates the degree of similarity in other areas. The plot comparison has inaccuracies, particularly in describing Office Space's climax and resolution, which are less dramatic and more focused on personal change rather than direct action. The settings are fundamentally different, with Raiders of the Lost Ark featuring exotic, historical locations and Office Space set in a contemporary, mundane office environment. The thematic comparison acknowledges some shared elements of disillusionment and personal fulfillment but does not adequately address the distinct thematic focuses of each film."
