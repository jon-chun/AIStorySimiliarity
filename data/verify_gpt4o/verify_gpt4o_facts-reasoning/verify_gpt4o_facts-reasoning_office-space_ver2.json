        "Raiders of the Lost Ark is set during the rise of Nazi Germany, not World War II.",

        "Office Space is primarily set in a generic suburban office park, not specifically during the dot-com boom.",

    ],
    "reasoning_errors": "The similarity scores between Raiders of the Lost Ark and Office Space are overestimated. While both films involve protagonists rebelling against oppressive structures, their contexts, settings, and themes differ significantly. Raiders of the Lost Ark is an action-adventure film set in the 1930s, dealing with historical and supernatural elements, while Office Space is a contemporary comedy that satirizes corporate life. The character motivations, plot structures, and thematic elements diverge greatly, making the high similarity scores unjustified. Specific inaccuracies include the mischaracterization of Peter's motivations and the setting of Office Space. The themes of conformity and individuality in Office Space contrast with the adventure and historical preservation themes in Raiders of the Lost Ark."
