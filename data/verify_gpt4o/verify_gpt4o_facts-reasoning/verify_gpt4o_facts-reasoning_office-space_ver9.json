    ],
    "reasoning_errors": "The analysis attempts to draw parallels between 'Raiders of the Lost Ark' and 'Office Space' but overlooks key contextual differences. Indiana Jones is an archetypal hero with a strong sense of adventure, while Peter is a disillusioned office worker rebelling against corporate monotony. The comparison fails to account for the vastly different narrative tones, settings, and character motivations. The thematic comparison also falls short, as 'Raiders' focuses on adventure and the supernatural, while 'Office Space' satirizes corporate culture. Consequently, the reasoning for the similarity scores is flawed, leading to inaccurate assessments."
