    "reasoning_errors": "The comparison between 'Raiders of the Lost Ark' and 'Office Space' lacks accuracy in several key areas. Firstly, the characters' psychological profiles are not accurately matched. Indiana Jones is known for his high conscientiousness, not low, while Peter Gibbons is not a computer programmer. The settings are fundamentally different; 'Office Space' is set in a contemporary office environment, whereas 'Raiders' is set in various historical and archaeological sites. The plots are also vastly different, with 'Raiders' involving a supernatural climax and an adventure quest, while 'Office Space' revolves around corporate disillusionment and rebellion. Themes such as the battle between good and evil, historical preservation, and teamwork in 'Raiders' do not align with the themes of monotony, corporate life, and personal fulfillment in 'Office Space'. Therefore, the overall similarity score should be much lower, and the reasoning needs to address these critical discrepancies."
