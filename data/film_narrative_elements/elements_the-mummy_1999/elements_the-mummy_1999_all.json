###SETTING:

[
  {
    "time_period": "The screenplay is set in two main historical periods. The first is in the year 2134 B.C., during the reign of Pharaoh Seti I in ancient Egypt. This period is characterized by significant historical and cultural developments, including the practices of mummification and the high priesthood of Osiris. The second period is in 1925, a post-World War I era marked by colonial expeditions, significant archaeological discoveries, and a fascination with ancient civilizations.",
    "geographical_location": "The story transitions between several key locations. It begins in the ancient city of Thebes along the Nile in Egypt, renowned as the 'City of the Living' and the 'Crown jewel of Pharaoh Seti I'. The narrative then moves to various locations including Cairo, the Sahara Desert, and the fictional city of Hamunaptra, also known as the 'City of the Dead'. Each location provides unique environmental challenges and cultural settings, such as the dense urban environment of Cairo and the harsh, arid conditions of the Sahara.",
    "cultural_context": "The cultural backdrop is rich and diverse, reflecting the ancient Egyptian civilization with its complex religious beliefs, rituals, and societal norms. Key elements include the worship of deities like Osiris and Anubis, mummification practices, and the reverence for pharaohs. In the 1925 setting, there is a blend of British colonial influence and traditional Egyptian culture, showcasing the contrast between Western explorers and local traditions. The characters navigate various cultural landscapes, from the structured societal norms of ancient Egypt to the cosmopolitan mix of 1920s Cairo.",
    "social_class": "The narrative explores distinct social hierarchies and class divisions. In ancient Egypt, the story features the aristocracy represented by Pharaoh Seti I, the high priest Imhotep, and the royal mistress Anck-su-namun. The social dynamics are further highlighted by the presence of slaves, priests, and soldiers. In the 1925 setting, characters like Rick O'Connell, a former Legionnaire, interact with different social strata, including British scholars, local Egyptian workers, and the corrupt prison warden, illustrating the hierarchical structures and class distinctions of the time.",
    "ideology_and_beliefs": "The story delves into various belief systems and ideologies. Ancient Egyptian beliefs in the afterlife, curses, and the power of the Book of the Dead play crucial roles. Characters like Imhotep and Anck-su-namun are driven by their forbidden love and the desire to overcome death. In the 1925 setting, the motivations are influenced by a mix of colonialist ambitions, the pursuit of archaeological knowledge, and personal greed. The narrative also explores themes of loyalty, betrayal, and the moral dilemmas faced by the characters.",
    "economic_and_political_context": "The economic and political context is pivotal in driving the plot. In ancient Egypt, the political climate is shaped by the rule of Pharaoh Seti I and the power struggles within his court. The economic conditions are reflected in the wealth associated with royal burials and treasures. In the 1925 setting, the post-World War I economic landscape includes colonial expeditions funded by wealthy patrons and governments. The pursuit of Hamunaptra's treasures reflects the broader economic motivations and disparities of the era, with characters like the warden and the American adventurers driven by the promise of immense wealth."
