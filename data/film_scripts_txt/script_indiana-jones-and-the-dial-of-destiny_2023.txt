In 213 BC, Roman forces led by Marcellus laid siege to the city of Syracuse.
“Syracuse.”
Not the Syracuse in New York, Tonya.
The one in Sicily.
Amongst the defenders of the city was its most famous resident, who was…
Come on, guys. This is on the final.
Archimedes.
Archimedes.
Archimedes, who was a…
A mathematician.
INDIANA: A mathematician.
But more than that, an inventor, a brilliant engineer who conceived of a way to 
harness the energy of the Mediterranean sun on concave mirrors and focus it on 
attacking Roman warships and set them on fire.
Who devised giant iron claws that could snatch hostiles from the sea.
But how do we know it really happened?
What physical, irrefutable archeological evidence is there of these inventions?
The Antikythera.

Archeology. Wow.
Apple didn’t fall far.
Well, now I’m researching a doctorate.
(CHUCKLES SOFTLY) What’s your subject?
The Archimedes Dial.
The Antikythera.
What do you know about that?
Well, for starters, in 1902, Greek sponge divers found a wrecked Roman warship, 
huge, off the coast of Greece.
Below deck, sealed in wax, was a clocklike mechanism, finely tooled, purpose 
unknown.
Nothing approximating its complexity appears in the world for 1,000 years.
You’ve done your homework.
Well, not me.
Dad. He had all these journals, reams of notes about it.
He was obsessed till the end.
(SIGHS)
He told me you found it on a Nazi plunder train.
And then lost it in a river in the French Alps.
Hmm. Well, that was a long time ago.
And it was only half the Dial.
Archimedes… Archimedes broke the Dial… disassembled it. in two, and then hid the two
halves from the Romans during the siege of Syracuse.
I know. Look.
You don’t remember the last time I saw you, do you?
Remember what?
These are the Alps.
Yeah, I see.
And this is the route that your train took from the Nazi stronghold in ’44.
Right.
HELENA: It went through this mountain pass, and then here.
Here, it’s the only river on the route.
Right.
Under a bridge.
It’s down there. It’s got to be.
And nobody knows except us.
“Us”?
Well, I mean, you.
And me. So, yeah.
Us.
Us.
And what were you thinking exactly?
Well, that maybe… we could go there.
And?
And find it. And… And I’d become… famous.
Oh, well, not famous. Renowned. Feted.
A feted archeologist.
And you, a final triumph!

Basil became obsessed by this German theory.
Conjecture, really.
Archimedes had figured out that the movements of the moon and planets weren’t 
perfect.
There were irregularities in their rotations.
He thought these irregularities might explain fluctuations in temperature, tides.
Storms, even.
So, he set about building a device to predict them.
But then, he stumbled upon a method to predict even larger disturbances.
Larger disturbances?
Your father thought this thing could predict fissures in time.

You really don’t remember the last time I was at your house?
I took that from him then.
I thought he’d stopped thinking about it.
But your father was convinced this thing was real and dangerous.
(WHISPERING) Do not shoot.
He was terrified that if somebody found this legendary tablet, the Grafikos…
The tablet containing directions to the rest of the Dial.
And if they found the Grafikos, they might acquire the other half of the Dial and 
put the two together.
I knew you wouldn’t destroy it.
How did you know he asked me to destroy it?
What?
You do remember that night.

its annual auction of stolen antiquities.
All the big players are already there.
Alia, Jabari.
This is the great man who brought our family to America during the war.
Quick, when was the Suez Crisis?
(SCOFFS) 1956.
Very impressive, Jabari.
My grandchildren watch too much TV, but they know their history.
They understand what it is to be American and Egyptian.
I need a ride to the airport, Sallah.
If you run, the police will assume that you’re guilty.
Without Helena or the Dial, I’m gonna get framed for murder.
Have you thought about calling Marion?
She doesn’t wanna talk to me.
WOMAN: (ON PA) Welcome to New York’s John F. Kennedy International Airport.
The upper level is for Pan American Airlines…
I took something else from your apartment.
It was under the bed.
(WISTFUL MUSIC PLAYING)
Thanks, Sallah.
I also brought my passport.
I could help you.
In Tangier?
Wherever chance takes us.
Indy, I… I miss the desert.
I miss the sea.
And I miss waking up every morning wondering what wonderful adventure the new day 
will bring to us.
This is not an adventure, Sallah.
Those days have come and gone.
Perhaps.
Perhaps not.
Give ’em hell, Indiana Jones!
(TIRES SCREECH)
Champagne?
We’ve got four more hours to Tangier.
Your scotch, sir.
Thanks.
(SOFT KNOCKING)
Basil. Come on, Baz!
Open the door!
BASIL: No!
Stay out, Indy!
Open the door.
(DOOR SCRAPES)
(BOTTLES CLINKING)
The Germans were right, Indy.
INDIANA: Huh? What?
It’s too big. It’s too much.
Hey, Ba… Hey, hey! Hey, Baz!
Give me…
No.
What are you doing?
You’ve listened to nothing that I said.
I don’t understand it, Baz!
Well, I was trying to explain it to you downstairs.
You’ve just ignored everything.
You’re terrifying your daughter.
Indy, Archimedes discovered a temporal meteorology.
Archimedes was a mathematician, Baz, not a magician.
He could predict fissures in time.
(CHUCKLES) Fissures in time?
Baz, you can’t prove that!
Well, not yet.
Proving it is what makes it science!
(CHUCKLES RUEFULLY)
(PENSIVE MUSIC PLAYING)
Oh, Baz.
I never should’ve given you the thing.
It… It belongs in a museum.
Give it to me. Please.
(BREATHING SHAKILY)
If I give you this, it must be destroyed.
I will.
I’ll destroy it, Baz.
Promise.
I’m sorry about this.
It’s all my fault.
Are you gonna be here?
Yes, sir.
Okay. I’ve gotta catch an airplane.
If anyone finds the Grafikos, they’ll have both halves.
Some things should stay buried.
INDIANA: I know, Baz.
BASIL: It’s vital that you destroy it.
INDIANA: I will, Baz.
BASIL: Do you understand?
INDIANA: I’ll destroy it. Yes.
BASIL: Say you will, Indy.
INDIANA: I will… Yes.
BASIL: You promised me. Remember that.
I will… I promise.
BASIL: There’s a reason, a reason that Archimedes broke it in two.
I know, Baz.
Indy.
Ah.
Thanks, Wombat.
He’s gonna be all right in a few days.
I’ll call you as soon as I land.
FLIGHT ATTENDANT: (ON PA) Ladies and gentlemen, we are 20 minutes from landing in 
Tangier.

AUCTIONEER: All right, let’s start at 20,000.
20,000, thank you very much.
30. 30.
Gauges green, power full, and when I reach 85, I rotate.
What next?
Louis, help him! He’s so cute.
Pull back on the yoke.
I did, man. I’m airborne.
Yeah, he’s airborne.
Can I have a sip?
Do I pick up the flaps?
Don’t touch the flaps under 400 feet.
Decrease your pitch to get to 120.
All right.
Private auction, old timer.
I’ve gotta get in there.
No password, no entry. I don’t make the rules.
DUTCH PRINCE: And, uh, what is the current bid?
The bid is 50,000.
Then I bid 55.
(SPEAKS FRENCH) Who’ll give me 60?
60.
60. 65?
(WOMAN BIDS IN CANTONESE)
65. 70?
DUTCH PRINCE: 75.
75. 80?
80.
85.
INDIANA: How about 90?
(CHUCKLES DRYLY)
This auction is private.
This auction’s over.
Au contraire, it’s hardly begun.
DUTCH PRINCE: 100.
100,000.
I like the hat, by the way.
Makes you look at least two years younger.
Thanks.
(MAN 3 BIDS IN ITALIAN)
110, bravo.
I told you that
this auction is over.
Excuse me, who is this man?
I’m her godfather.
He’s mildly related.
And she’s up past her bedtime.
Come on, Wombat.
I wouldn’t do that.
You want to explain it to the cops at the bar?
The ones I paid off?
You’re out of your depth, Jonesy.
“Jonesy”?
He thinks I’m a criminal.
He’s the one wanted for murder.
Nice big picture in the New York Herald. 130?
I didn’t kill anyone.
No entry, it’s a private auction.
INDIANA: And you know it, Helena.
But whoever did was looking for this.
What you’ve got here is Pandora’s Box.
No, actually.
It’s my box.
You.
Have we met?
No.
INDIANA: My memory is a little fuzzy, but your face rings a bell.
Are you still a Nazi?
(CHOKES, COUGHS)
(SCOFFS)
You’re confused. My name is Schmidt.
Professor Schmidt of Alabama University.
Professor Schmidt. How nice to meet you in person.
(SPEAKING CANTONESE)
150.
DR. SCHMIDT: After our conversation, Miss Shaw, I thought we’d come to an agreement 
about the Dial.
INDIANA: Funny. The last time I saw the other guy who looks like you, he was also 
after this.
Your numbers were light, Professor Schmidt.
But good news is, you’re here now. The bid is 160.
DR. SCHMIDT: You don’t seem to understand, Miss Shaw.
This relic is my property.
It’s not yours. You stole it.
Then you stole it.
And then I stole it. It’s called capitalism.
The bid is 160.
MAN 4: 160.
HELENA: 170?
You should’ve stayed in New York.
HELENA: 170?
You should’ve stayed out of Poland.
HELENA: 170. Anyone? Anyone?

You’re in pajamas.
I was sleeping, Helena.
HELENA: Mmhmm. RAHIM: Peacefully.
Oh.
My father woke me.
He told me you’d returned to our hotel.
Then he handed me this scimitar and told me to come home with your head.
Huh.
Does it have to be that bit?
(PANTING)
I thought maybe you returned because you loved me.
Rahim, I had an item to sell.
Excuse me. The item she’s talking about actually belongs to me.
No.
You do not need to intrude in this conversation.
And some very bad people, worse people…
You do not need to get involved with my business.
…have run off with it.
Is this your new man?
No. No, no, no, no.
It’s complicated.
(SPEAKING ARABIC)
What exactly do you owe this guy?
Just some bail money and a lifetime of happiness.
I presume you sold the ring.
It didn’t go for as much as I thought it would.
I’ll do it!
INDIANA: What are you… Hey!
(SCREAMING)
(SHOUTING IN ARABIC)

Ah.
Damn.
MASON: Yeah.
I know, sir.
Yes… (SIGHS)
Copy.
They pulled the plug.
You got them scared.
Because they don’t understand.
No. Because your associates killed three American civilians and blew up a nationally
televised parade.
Because you stood up the President of the United States, ran to Morocco, and created
an incident that required military extraction!
Then take me to DC, and I will explain it all.
They want you to vanish.
We have half the Dial now.
(MASON SIGHS)
They were just trying to keep you happy, letting you chase that thing.
They never cared about it.
DR. SCHMIDT: They will, Miss Mason, when they understand what it can do.
MASON: You put them on the moon.
They got what they wanted.
All right, buckle up. We’re landing in Spain.

I’m not going back to Alabama!
All we need is a vessel to take us to the Mediterranean.

Orville and Wilbur.
They invented the airplane, and they lived in Indiana.
Wilbur was born in Indiana.
I’m not from Indiana, Teddy.
And the Wright Brothers were born during the Civil War.
Oh, I thought maybe you went to school with them.
(HELENA LAUGHS)
Oh, come on, Indy. That was funny.
“Funny”?
Mmhmm.
I’m stuck in Tangier with a broken tuk-tuk and two thieves.
I’m wanted for murder.
Nazis have half of Archimedes’ Dial and your father’s notebooks.
I have a copy.
Dad’s notebooks. I made a copy.
Where?
(GRUNTS)
You memorized five notebooks?
Seven. And of course not.
Half of them were as dull as ditchwater.
Just the really important bits.
Like what?
The location of the Grafikos.
Nobody knows where the Grafikos is.
Dad did.
No, he didn’t.
Yes, he did.
No, he didn’t.
Yes, he did.
What’s a Grafikos?
It’s directions to the rest of the Dial.
Ask her if she knows what language it’s in.
Ah! It isn’t in a language. It’s in a code.
What code?
Archimedes used two codes.
Linear B and Polybius Square.
So, even if you find the Grafikos, without me, you can’t read it.
(CHUCKLES) Please.
Dad taught me Polybius when I was nine.
Used to leave little notes around the house.
“Tidy your room.”
“Stay away from my brandy.”
What if it’s Linear B?
50 quid it’s Polybius.
Give me that.
Hey.

I’m going to Casablanca.
Then I’m gonna hop a plane to the Aegean.
Just like you.
What makes you think we’re going to the Aegean?
You gotta get to the Grafikos before the Nazis.
Archimedes was surrounded by Romans.
Where else would it be?
The Aegean is huge, Indy.
And you don’t have coordinates.
And you don’t have a boat.
(CHUCKLES FORCEDLY)
I’ve got an old friend in Greece.
An expert diver.
With a big, beautiful boat that’ll get us there before they will.
You need me, and you know it.

(INDIANA AND RENALDO LAUGHING)
INDIANA: You got a different boat.
(GROANS)
Stop it.
We’re going here.
Where they found the first part of the Antikythera.
But… (SIGHS) we’re going deeper.
Dad tracked down the old sponge diver who found the Dial.
He told him that the wrecked Roman ship broke up under the sea 70 feet below.
Filled with the skeletons of over 100 centurions.
That’s where they found it.
But he said that most of the ship had broken off and sunk to the ocean floor.
Too deep for sponge divers.
So, Dad started wondering why a Roman warship would sail out of Syracuse with 100 
centurions on board.
They weren’t taking half a Dial for a joyride.
They had the Grafikos… and they were looking for the rest of the Dial.
Your dad was a genius.
Yeah.
He was.

Written over and over again in this letter.
August 20th, 1969.
That’s three days from now.
And the same date in 1939.
Two weeks before Hitler invades Poland.
(LAUGHS) Wait.
Now you believe the Dial has magical powers?
I don’t believe in magic, Wombat.
But a few times in my life, I’ve seen things.
Things I can’t explain.
And I’ve come to believe it’s not so much what you believe.
It’s how hard you believe it.
I’ve seen things too, Indy.
The only thing worth believing in, ever, is cash.
(PAPER RUSTLING)
Right.
What if you could go back in time?
What would you do?
Witness the Trojan War?
Check in on Cleopatra?
I’d stop my son from enlisting.
Did he sign up to please you?
No, he signed up to piss me off.
How would you have stopped him?
(VOICE WAVERING) I’d tell him he was gonna die.
I’d tell him that his mother would… find no end to her grief.

VOLLER: I think you will find this is worth more than your asking price.
(EXHALES)
Teddy.
Helena, don’t do this.
(HELENA CLEARS THROAT)
Let’s see what we’ve got here.
“My Makhana… that’s “machine”… lies with me, in the city I left. Where wolves teach 
men to walk. Under one of nine, I lie.”
Only one thing lies anywhere forever.
The dead. So, if the Dial lies with him, then… then this is directions to his tomb.
The Tomb of Archimedes?
Undiscovered for two millennia.
“The city I left.”
Archimedes lived two places his entire life, so he only left one.
Anyone? At the back?
Come on, Indy. Everyone knows this.
Even this clown.
Alexandria.
Full marks. (LAUGHS)
Now, “wolf” in Greek is “lycos.”
Root of the word “lycaeum” or “school.”
And the Doric for “walking” is… “peripatio.”
Which also happens to be the word for…
Aw.
I thought you were a bright spark.
“Peripatio” means “walking,” but it also means “counting.”
So, “Where wolves teach men to walk” could be… The School of Mathematics.
Is correct.
Now, the next bit is easy.
“Beneath one of nine”?
There are nine Muses.
The Museon.
The Greek word for the Great Library of Alexandria.
Which, as we all know, has nine statues supporting its roof.
May I?
Thank you.
The nine Muses, in reverse order, are Calliope, Urania, Polymnia, Erato… Polymnia.
…and Meli whasisname, that other one, Thalia, Euteroe, but the first is… Clio.
The Muse of history and time.
That Archimedes, what a clever bugger.
DR. SCHMIDT: The entrance to the tomb is by the School of Mathematics, under a 
statue of Clio, in the ruins of the Great Library of Alexandria.
Gold star for Dr. Brains.

(HELENA SCOFFS)
Take the wheel, Teddy.
What does it say?
“Search where Dionysius hears each whisper like a hurricane.”
The Ear.
The cave of Dionysius.
Where is that?
In Sicily.

About what the hell I’m doing up here, 40 feet in the air, with crap shoulders,

Yeah, I get it. I get it.
No, you don’t get it.
You’re half my age.
You haven’t been forced to drink the blood of Kali.
No. Fair enough.
Or been tortured with voodoo.
And I’m just guessing, but I don’t think you’ve been shot nine times, including once
by your father.

Don’t talk to me.
Just go ahead. I’ll follow you.

The Cave of Dionysius.
No, no, no. The cave is closed for renovation.
Oh.
Let me ask again.
Where is the Cave of Dionysius?
(WATER FLOWING)
What’s the matter? You worried about the kid?
Are you sure they won’t hurt him?
He’ll be fine.
He’s smart.
Where’d you find him?
He, uh… He tried to steal my purse outside a casino in Marrakesh when he was 10.
I hit him repeatedly with my car door, but he didn’t let go and neither did I.
So, been together ever since.
Thought you were all about the money.
I am.

Archimedes used it.
