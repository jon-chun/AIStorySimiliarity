NATIONAL TREASURE
FADE IN ON:
1 EXT. GEORGETOWN STREETS, 1832 - NIGHT 1
Wet cobblestones are beaten by a heavy rain. A CARRIAGE
WHEEL splashes through huge puddles.
MAN'S VOICE
It was 1832...
2 EXT. CARRIAGE, MOVING - NIGHT 2
The carriage races through the darkened streets. A flash
of lightning illuminates the coachman. It's a drenched
boy, THOMAS GATES.
MAN'S VOICE
...Thomas Gates was ten years old.
Thomas whips the wild-eyed horse and turns a sharp corner.
3 INT. CARRIAGE, MOVING - NIGHT 3
Riding inside is CHARLES CARROLL. He's 96 years old. His
weak body wracks with coughs, death closing in.
MAN'S VOICE
Mr. Charles Carroll, the last
surviving signer of the Declaration
of Independence had asked Thomas to
take him to see President Andrew
Jackson. He said it was urgent.
4 EXT. THE WHITE HOUSE - NIGHT 4
Through the White House windows, we can see finely dressed
GENTLEMEN and WOMEN partying, old-school. Thomas pulls the
carriage to a stop, jumps down, and sprints to a DOORMAN.
THOMAS
The President must come quickly!
5 INT. CARRIAGE - NIGHT 5
Thomas opens the carriage door, but Carroll sits motionless.
THOMAS
Mr. Carroll?
Carroll peeks open an eye, coughs weakly.
CARROLL
(off Thomas' look)
He's not coming, is he?
National Treasure, 4/9/03 2.
5 CONTINUED: 5
THOMAS
They told me he was busy.
CARROLL
But the treasure! The treasure!
Carroll breaks into a fit of coughs. Thomas looks down and
sees that Carroll's handkerchief is stained with blood.
THOMAS
We should've gone to see the doctor.
Carroll suddenly pulls the boy close.
CARROLL
Listen now, or the secret dies with
me!
Carroll stares at Thomas, dead serious. Carroll's face is
ashen. A desperate look in his eyes. Thomas listens.
MAN'S VOICE
That night, Mr. Carroll told Thomas
about a great treasure, the greatest
treasure of them all...
FLASH TO:
6 A PYRAMID, EGYPT 2000 B.C. NIGHT. The surrounding city is 6
on fire.
7 INT. PYRAMID - NIGHT 7
Carrying torches, SLAVES bust down a stone wall, revealing
a DARK ROOM. A slave holds up his torch to see...
A ROOM MADE OF SOLID GOLD, filled with items made of gold
and precious stones.
MAN'S VOICE
...a treasure amassed throughout
all time...
As the slaves loot the Pharaoh's tomb, we PUSH IN on the
golden tomb walls which are decorated with MASONIC SYMBOLS: 
the ALL-SEEING EYE and the UNFINISHED PYRAMID.
8 EXT. JERUSALEM, 70 A.D. - NIGHT 8
ROMAN SOLDIERS carry treasure out of the burning Temple of
Solomon. We recognize the treasure as the same treasure
from Egypt, only now it includes more...
COPPER SCROLLS. A GOLD MENORAH. A GOLD BAS RELIEF.
MAN'S VOICE
...a treasure amassed over all
continents...
National Treasure, 4/9/03 3.
8 CONTINUED: 8
As the soldiers cart out the treasure, we see the same
Masonic symbols on the temple columns, then CUT TO...
9 A TREMENDOUS POUNDING. CLOSE ON men's hands wearing 9
armored gloves. They draw straws. One hand pulls the
SHORT STRAW. We WIDEN to reveal we're in...
10 INT. CHURCH, 14TH CENTURY FRANCE - NIGHT 10
A group of KNIGHTS wearing Masonic insignia on their armor
look to their brother with the short straw. The POUNDING
INTENSIFIES. SOLDIERS are banging down the church doors.
MAN'S VOICE
...a treasure the Knights of the
Templar found and swore to protect...
The Knight with the short straw surrenders his armor, dons
a MONK'S ROBE, and slips out just as SOLDIERS burst through
the church doors. The outnumbered KNIGHTS fight bravely.
11 EXT. FOREST - NIGHT 11
The knight who got away leads a small caravan through the
forest. In the carriages, hidden under tarps...the TREASURE.
12 EXT. CASTLE COURTYARD - DAY 12
KING PHILIP OF FRANCE watches emotionless as the Knights
who didn't escape are BURNED AT THE STAKE. 
MAN'S VOICE
...even when faced with death. For
the Knights believed that a treasure
so great was not meant for any one
man, king or not.
The knights' screams are drowned out by the sound of the
ocean as we CUT TO...
13 EXT. ATLANTIC OCEAN, 1492 - DAY 13
A ship laden with the treasure crosses the stormy sea. The
ship's name...the SANTA MARIA.
MAN'S VOICE
...The Templar Knights who escaped
execution took the treasure to the
New World...
At the ship's helm is CHRISTOPHER COLUMBUS. We PUSH IN on
a medallion hanging around his neck. On it, the PYRAMID
and ALL-SEEING EYE.
MAN'S VOICE (CONT'D)
...The Knights were fugitives and
developed secret passwords and signs
of their order...
National Treasure, 4/9/03 4.
13 CONTINUED: 13
We KEEP PUSHING IN on the medallion until the PYRAMID fills
the screen. We then transition to...
14 EXT. THE PYRAMID OF THE SUN, 1521 - DAY 14
AZTECS hurriedly unload the TREASURE from the pyramid as
Hernando Cortes and his army attack the city. 
MAN'S VOICE
...The treasure survived many more
wars and was moved many times...
15 INT. CRYPT, 1779 - NIGHT 15
Carrying a lantern, a MAN wearing a tricorn hat closes the
stone door on the treasure. The man is COUNT CASIMIR
PULASKI, general of the Continental Army.
MAN'S VOICE
...Some believe it was buried in
Nova Scotia, but Mr. Carroll told
Thomas the treasure had been hidden
by the Freemasons, the descendants
of the Templar Knights. These
descendants included such men as
Patrick Henry, Benjamin Franklin,
George Washington...
16 EXT. BATTLEFIELD, SAVANNAH, GEORGIA 1779 - DAY 16
Rallying his troops against the Red Coats, PULASKI takes a
musket ball in the chest and falls from his horse.
MAN'S VOICE
...and other soldiers who fought
bravely for the Continental Army
during the Revolutionary War. Men
like Count Casimir Pulaski who died
in the Siege of Savannah...
17 CUT TO LATER. SOLDIERS comb through the battlefield 17
carnage. They find Pulaski's dead body and roll him over. 
On his finger, we now see he's wearing a silver ring
bearing the ALL-SEEING EYE and PYRAMID symbols.
MAN'S VOICE
...and took the secret to the
whereabouts of the treasure to his
grave...
The soldiers search Pulaski but find only a piece of paper
with one word written on it: "CHARLOTTE."
FLASH BACK TO:
18 INT. CARRIAGE - NIGHT 18
With his last breath of life...
National Treasure, 4/9/03 5.
18 CONTINUED: 18
CARROLL
...The secret lies with Charlotte. 
Find her, and you will find the
treasure. Tell the President. 
Tell no one else.
With that, Carroll dies. We now notice that Carroll is
also wearing a MASONIC RING. 
Suddenly, the carriage door opens to reveal PRESIDENT ANDREW
JACKSON, a tall man with flowing grey hair. He looks to
Mr. Carroll, but he's...too late.
PRESIDENT JACKSON
Poor old fool. Coming all the way
here in the pouring rain.
19 EXT. THE WHITE HOUSE - NIGHT 19
President Jackson starts back. Thomas hurries after him.
THOMAS
Wait! Mr. Carroll wanted me to
tell you something.
PRESIDENT JACKSON
If this is about that damned treasure--
THOMAS
--You know of it?
PRESIDENT JACKSON
He's spoken of it no less than a
hundred times.
THOMAS
He said Charlotte has it.
PRESIDENT JACKSON
We've been looking for Charlotte
for years. She doesn't exist.
The president stops and looks at Thomas.
PRESIDENT JACKSON (CONT'D)
Who are you, young man?
THOMAS
Thomas Gates. 
PRESIDENT JACKSON
Well, you'd best forget anything
Mr. Carroll told you. The treasure
is a legend. Nothing more.
With that, President Jackson turns back to the White House. 
We PUSH IN ON Thomas' face, watching the President go.
National Treasure, 4/9/03 6.
19 CONTINUED: 19
MAN'S VOICE
Well, Thomas never forgot...
DISSOLVE TO:
20 INT. RETIREMENT HOME, REC ROOM, 1983 - DAY 20
ELDERLY FOLKS watch current President Ronald Reagan on T.V.
while JOHN ADAMS GATES (75) finishes regaling his wide-eyed,
10-year-old grandson BEN FRANKLIN GATES with his tale. (We
realize now that the MAN'S VOICE belongs to John.)
JOHN
Thomas looked for Charlotte...
John Gates' face reflects a long life spent challenging the
elements. He turns a page in a tattered OLD SCRAPBOOK. 
CLOSE ON a black and white photo. A grown-up Thomas Gates
stands at a excavation site, Aztec ruins in the background. 
The caption: "Thomas Gates, Teotihuacan, Mexico 1856"
JOHN (O.S.) (CONT'D)
...As did his son, George Washington
Gates...
John turns the page to another photo of another GATES. All
the Gates men bear a strong family resemblance.
JOHN (CONT'D)
...Generation after generation, our
ancestors have tried to find
Charlotte and failed.
BEN
Maybe Charlotte is an anagram. You
know, you rearrange the letters,
and it means something else.
John stops. He's never thought of that before.
JOHN
Like "hotel crate."
BEN
That's too many e's. It'd have to
be the "hotel cart," or "tear cloth"
or "teal torch" or "Rachel Ott."
Ben quickly rattles off the anagrams. John is impressed.
JOHN
Maybe you'll be the one who finally
finds her.
BEN
How will I know it's the right
Charlotte when I do?
National Treasure, 4/9/03 7.
20 CONTINUED: 20
John pulls out a $1-bill and presses it on his T.V. tray.
JOHN
Because she'll be marked with these.
CLOSE ON the $1-bill. John's craggy finger points to the
UNFINISHED PYRAMID and ALL-SEEING EYE on the back.
JOHN (CONT'D)
The unfinished pyramid and the allseeing eye. The marks of the Knights
of the Templar.
Ben studies the dollar-bill with newfound curious awe.
JOHN (CONT'D)
Our founding fathers, the Freemasons,
designed our nation's Great Seal
and left us all the clues. These
symbols are telling us something. 
I just don't know what.
BEN
Don't worry, grandpa. I'll figure
it out, and I'll find her. I swear.
MAN'S VOICE (O.S.)
You swear what?
They turn to find Ben's father PATRICK HENRY GATES (40s). 
Patrick looks just like his father, albeit decades younger. 
BEN
That I'll find Charlotte.
Patrick shoots a baleful look to his dad. 
PATRICK
Dammit, dad. How many times have I
told you? Ben's not going to waste
his time chasing a treasure that
doesn't exist. 
JOHN
He's a Gates. It's in his blood. 
Ben's gonna look for it, just like
you did and I did.
PATRICK
He's smarter than us. Ben's going
to Harvard. He's going to be a
lawyer or a doctor. Right, Ben?
Ben looks to his dad, then to his grandpa, then back to his
dad as we DISSOLVE TO...WHITE. All we can hear is...
BEEP...BEEP...BEEP. A heart monitor? The beeping fades.
National Treasure, 4/9/03 8.
20 CONTINUED: (2) 20
GROWN-UP BEN'S VOICE
We're losing her...
We WIDEN to reveal we're in...
21 EXT. SNOWCAT, MOVING - DAY 21
Dressed in heavy arctic gear, intrepid explorer BEN GATES
(late 20s, strong family resemblance) monitors a laptop.
ON THE SCREEN, red and blue dots signifying amplitudes make
random patterns on a subsurface trace of BEEPING GPR pulses. 
BEN
...Go left.
The driver, RILEY POOLE (25, unkempt), cranks the wheel. 
22 EXT. BARREN ARCTIC LANDSCAPE - DAY 22
The SNOWCAT (The Endeavor) trundles left, its tractor treads
clawing through the ice. The Endeavor also has giant screwshaped pontoons to propel over water.
23 EXT. THE ENDEAVOR, MOVING - DAY 23
Riley wipes the frost from the window.
RILEY
Maybe she's not here. 
BEN
She's here.
RILEY
We've been looking for weeks. You're
going on data that's 200 years old.
BEN
200-year-old data is usually the
kind of data you go on when you're
looking for something that's been
lost for 200 years.
RILEY
Sailors have a way of exaggerating
you know. What if the storm wasn't
as big as they said it was? We
could be hundreds of miles off.
Ben scans the landscape ahead where the ice ends in a SHEER
GLACIAL CLIFF. 
BEN
The Inuits said they could still
see the masts poking up through the
ice just three generations ago.
National Treasure, 4/9/03 9.
23 CONTINUED: 23
RILEY
Were they smoking anything at the
time?
BEN
Only for medicinal purposes.
Just then, the GPR BLEEPS loudly. They both look to...
THE COMPUTER SCREEN. We now see that the red and blue dots
have taken an unmistakable shape...A BLOB WITH SPLATTERS.
Ben and Riley exchange a look. Hopeful but wary.
RILEY
Could be a frozen whale.
24 CUT TO AN ICE AX. It swings hard, shattering the ice, 24
revealing a WOMAN'S FROZEN FACE. We PULL BACK to reveal...
25 EXT. ARCTIC LANDSCAPE - DAY 25
Ben chips away the ice. AS THE ICE is chipped away, we see
the face is CARVED OUT OF WOOD. 
BEN
Isn't she beautiful?
Ben grins. When Riley sees the face, he is stunned.
RILEY
I'll radio base camp.
26 EXT. ARCTIC LANDSCAPE - DAY - LATER 26
Holding a pole (used for measuring snow depth) Ben and Riley
watch as three SNOWMOBILES approach and pull to stops.
RILEY
I'd hate to be you right now. A
lot of people relying on you. A
lot of money riding on this.
BEN
I'd hate to be you right now. All
that cholesterol and hair where
it's not supposed to be.
A man wearing expensive high-tech gear hops out of a snowcat. 
This is IAN HOWE (40s, British). A rich adventurer.
IAN
Gates! Where is she?
Ben gestures to the figurehead in the snow. When Ian sees
the woman's face, he grins like a kid on Christmas morning.
National Treasure, 4/9/03 10.
26 CONTINUED: 26
IAN (CONT'D)
Bloody hell, you found it. You
really found it! You're a genius!
RILEY
I told you if you underwrote this
expedition, you wouldn't be sorry.
IAN
(calls to his crew)
Shaw! Get the champagne.
Ian drops to his knees and studies the figurehead's face,
almost disbelieving.
IAN (CONT'D)
You know how many expeditions I've
financed that've turned up nothing?
RILEY
Well now, we're all about to be
rich, and it's a beautiful thing.
A solidly built man (SHAW) approaches, without the champagne. 
Shaw is the type of man who'd do anything for hire.
IAN
Shaw? The champagne?
SHAW
I thought we were looking for a 
100-foot frigate.
BEN
We were. She is.
SHAW
Then how come GPR indicates this
ship's only 81-feet long?
Shaw hands Ben a GPR printout. Ben reads it.
BEN
Because this is a 2-dimensional
rendering of a 3-dimensional object. 
The image is only 81-feet long
because the ship's canted.
SHAW
Canted?
BEN
Tipped. Tilted. Lying at an angle.
IAN
How canted?
National Treasure, 4/9/03 11.
26 CONTINUED: (2) 26
RILEY
By our calculations, about 35°. 
Which means the stern's about 57
feet down.
SHAW
57 feet down?! Christ! We'll be
digging for a week.
BEN
No, we won't.
Ben slams the POLE DOWN INTO the ice, puncturing a small
hole. WHOOSH of wind blows up on them. Ben shrugs.
BEN (CONT'D)
Air pocket.
27 EXT. ARCTIC LANDSCAPE - DAY - LATER 27
The Endeavor is now parked next to a newly bored hole into
the ice. Shaw mans a winch while...
Two more workers direct a steel cable which plays out from
the Endeavor's front end. These men are SHIPPEN intense,
ex-Army, and POWELL, brawny, ex-con.
We follow the steel cable down which disappears down into...
28 INT. HOLE IN THE ICE - DAY 28
Daylight illuminates the cylindrical blue walls of this
narrow opening. Wearing a helmet and headlamp, Riley rides
down on the cable which is lowering a heavy generator...
29 INT. ICE CAVE - DAY 29
Riley joins Ben and Ian who are staring at something we
don't immediately see. We REVERSE to reveal... 
A nearly perfectly preserved SHIP, tipped 35°, its hull and
stern frozen in a wall of this vast ice cave.
The ship is wooden with three masts. Its ancient sails are
wrapped in its frozen casings. Icicles hang from frozen
ropes. One of the ship's masts is broken. The other two
tower up until they are swallowed by the cave's ice ceiling. 
They all stare at the ship in its ghostlike beauty.
IAN
The frigate Charlotte. Last seen
leaving port from Maine in 1779.
RILEY
Looks like she ran into some bad
weather.
National Treasure, 4/9/03 12.
29 CONTINUED: 29
We FOLLOW Ben who trudges up the icy incline to the bow. 
With his glove, he wipes away the snow. 
Through a thick layer of ice, we can make out the ship's
name..."CHARLOTTE." 
BEN
Hello, sweetheart.
30 CUT TO ARC LIGHTS BEING LIT. We PULL BACK to reveal... 30
31 INT. ICE CAVE - DAY - LATER 31
The cave is now illuminated by intense lights powered by
generators. A nylon rope ladder and cables dangle down
from the hole in the cave's ceiling.
Shaw, Powell, and Shippen finish securing the ship with
ropes and spikes while Ben, Riley, and Ian don climbing
harnesses and snap ice crampons to their boots.
BEN
Riley, you take the berthing
quarters. Ian, check the Captain's
cabin. I'll take the cargo hold.
IAN
I'll take the cargo hold.
BEN
Suit yourself.
Ian rises. Moves to the ship. Riley shoots Ben a look.
RILEY
You dog. You wanted the Captain's
Cabin.
BEN
Hey, we're all just looking for the
same thing.
RILEY
Fine. Then, I want the Captain's
Cabin. 
BEN
Sure. Whatever you want.
Riley studies Ben. Now completely mind-fucked.
RILEY
OK, forget it. You're trying to
trick me, I know it. I got the
berthing quarters. You take the
crappy Captain's Cabin.
National Treasure, 4/9/03 13.
32 INT. ICE CAVE, SHIP'S DECK - DAY 32
Ian, Ben, and Riley move across the steeply angled deck. 
Each wears a helmet-lamp and carries a metal detector. The
old ship GROANS as the timbers shift under their weight. 
They cross the deck then move in different directions.
33 INT. SHIP, BERTHING QUARTERS - DAY 33
Riley ducks his head under frozen hammocks as he moves
through the cramped crew's quarters. He sweeps his metal
detector over the debris. Nothing.
34 INT. SHIP, GUN DECK - CONTINUOUS 34
Ian moves through the gun deck. The heavy iron cannons
have all slid across the floor and lie piled at the stern.
35 INT. SHIP, UPPER COMPANIONWAY - CONTINUOUS 35
Ben edges down a tilted staircase.
36 INT. SHIP, BERTHING QUARTERS - CONTINUOUS 36
Riley's headlamp light plays over the broken shelves, ropes,
boxes, then stops on...THREE MEN'S HEADS. Riley lets out a
startled GASP.
37 INT. SHIP, UPPER COMPANIONWAY - CONTINUOUS 37
Ben overhears Riley gasp on his radio headset.
BEN
Riley...?
38 INT. SHIP, BERTHING QUARTERS - CONTINUOUS 38
Warily, Riley comes around to find a trio of SEAMEN, bundled
in blankets, eerily frozen.
RILEY
Uh-huh?
BEN (VIA MIC)
Find something? 
RILEY
Uh-huh.
39 INTERCUT Ben. By the sound of Riley's voice, he knows... 39
BEN
Dead people?
RILEY (VIA MIC)
(voice cracking)
Uh-huh.
National Treasure, 4/9/03 14.
39 CONTINUED: 39
BEN
(laughs to himself)
What'd you expect? You're in the
berthing quarters.
Ben wrenches open a closed door. Its frozen hinges SQUEAL. 
40 INT. SHIP, CAPTAIN'S CABIN - CONTINUOUS 40
Ben finds an old oil lantern and lights it with a lighter. 
We then see the Captain's Cabin. Plush furniture. An ornate
desk. Everything covered in a thin layer of ice.
Ben moves to the desk and quickly rifles through it. He
finds nothing of value except for an antique POCKET WATCH
which he pockets. He then looks down and notices...
DEEP SCRATCHES in the floor by the desk. 
41 INT. SHIP, LOWER CARGO HOLD - CONTINUOUS 41
Ian gets a reading on his metal detector. He pushes aside
some netting. Finds a TRUNK. He pries it open...DISHES. 
42 INT. SHIP, CAPTAIN'S CABIN - CONTINUOUS 42
Ben pushes the desk aside, revealing a TRAP DOOR underneath. 
He pulls it open. Peers down to find a dark, hidden room.
43 INT. SHIP, HIDDEN ROOM - CONTINUOUS 43
Ben jumps down, looks around. The room is crowded with
large BARRELS. He pulls one of the plugs, and... 
BLACK GUNPOWDER spills out into a pile onto the icy floor.
Ben turns to go then notices...
TWO BOOTS poking out from between a row of barrels. Ben
moves to the row and finds...
THE CAPTAIN. Frozen dead. Gun in his lap. Leaning up
against one of the barrels.
44 INT. SHIP, CAPTAIN'S CABIN - CONTINUOUS 44
Riley enters to find Ben nowhere in sight.
BEN (O.S.)
Down here!
He hurries to the trap door and peers down to see Ben
struggling with the barrel of gunpowder. 
RILEY
You found it!
National Treasure, 4/9/03 15.
45 INT. SHIP, HIDDEN ROOM - CONTINUOUS 45
Riley jumps down into the room as Ben pries open the barrel.
RILEY
There's gold in there. I can smell
it.
Excited, Riley watches as Ben lifts the lid to reveal...more
gunpowder. But Riley is undaunted.
RILEY (CONT'D)
Maybe it's in another barrel.
But Ben sticks both arms into the barrel he opened.
BEN
The Captain was guarding this barrel
for a reason.
As Ben roots around, gunpowder SPILLS ALL OVER THE FLOOR. 
After a beat, Ben finally stops. He's found something. He
exchanges a look with Riley, then pulls out a SMALL BOX. 
It's labeled "Little Hunting Creek, Virginia." 
Ben carefully opens it, revealing...AN IVORY PIPE. 
BEN (CONT'D)
Riley. Do you know what this is?
Riley eyes it, disappointed.
RILEY
I'm hoping a billion-dollar pipe?
46 INT. SHIP, CAPTAIN'S CABIN - CONTINUOUS 46
Ian enters as Ben and Riley emerge from the trap door.
BEN
Ian! Look at this!
Ben shows him the pipe. Ian glances at it, unimpressed.
IAN
A Meerschaum pipe. 18th Century. 
I have three.
BEN
This box is marked Little Hunting
Creek. That's what Mt. Vernon was
called before George Washington's
family renamed it.
IAN
George Washington's pipe. And?
National Treasure, 4/9/03 16.
46 CONTINUED: 46
BEN
And it's gonna lead us to the
treasure.
IAN
"Lead us?" You said the treasure
would be on Charlotte.
BEN
No, I said "the secret lies with
Charlotte." This pipe has to be
that secret.
Ben strains to make out something on the pipe.
BEN (CONT'D)
There're markings on here. I need
some ink.
IAN
I didn't spend a quarter of a million
dollars to find a pipe.
Ben finds a quill and a bottle of ink, but the ink is frozen.
BEN
Come on, Ian. This is a treasure
hunt. You can't just find it in
the first place you look.
IAN
It only took me three weeks to find
the Panamanian Galleon wreck with
my last so-called expert. I've
been funding you for six months.
BEN
Seven.
Ben takes the quill and suddenly stabs his finger with the
tip. Riley sees this and winces.
RILEY
What the hell're you doing?
Ben rubs his blood on the pipe, then rolls the pipe over
the desktop, revealing...AN IMPRINT IN BLOOD. We recognize
the symbols: THE ALL-SEEING EYE and UNFINISHED PYRAMID. 
IAN
The Templar symbols.
RILEY
Does it say where the treasure is?
Ben reads from the bloody imprint on the desk.
National Treasure, 4/9/03 17.
46 CONTINUED: (2) 46
BEN
"The legend writ, the stain effected
The key in Silence undetected
Fifty-five in iron pen 
Mr. Matlack can't offend."
RILEY
I didn't hear the part about "X"
marks the spot.
IAN
What does it mean?
BEN
It's a riddle. "Key" and "legend."
It's referring to a map.
RILEY
What map?
BEN
"Undetected" and "in silence" means
the map is hidden.
IAN
Of course. A hidden map. Where?
Ian picks up the pipe. Studies it. 
IAN (CONT'D)
"Iron pen" could mean iron manacles,
iron bars...55 men in prison! Or,
no, wait. Perhaps 55 refers to the
year 1755. Who's "Mr. Matlack"?
BEN
Timothy Matlack. The official scribe
of the Continental Congress.
(realizes)
"Iron" because they used iron-based
inks back then.
RILEY
Scribe. A writer?
BEN
No, a calligrapher. He transcribed
documents for the Continental
Congress. 
RILEY
So, Mr. Matlack made a map. Where
would he hide it?
IAN
"Mr. Matlack can't offend." Why
can't he offend it?
National Treasure, 4/9/03 18.
46 CONTINUED: (3) 46
BEN
It means he didn't write over the
map. It's probably on the back of
something he transcribed.
RILEY
What'd he transcribe?
BEN
Lots of things. The most famous
document being...
His voice trails off.
RILEY
Being what? The Constitution? The
Bill of Rights?
BEN
No. 
RILEY
(relieved)
Thank God.
BEN
The Declaration of Independence.
A beat of incredulity, then Riley scoffs...
RILEY
There's no map on the back of the
Declaration of Independence.
Ben gives him a look, like yes there is.
RILEY (CONT'D)
There's a map on the back of the
Declaration of Independence?!
IAN
It's brilliant if you think about
it. Such an important document
insured the map's survival. 
BEN
Too bad we'll never see it.
IAN
Nonsense. We get a viewing.
BEN
Nobody gets a viewing. Not even
the President.
National Treasure, 4/9/03 19.
46 CONTINUED: (4) 46
RILEY
What kind of sick person would put
a treasure map on the back of the
Declaration of Independence?!
BEN
Could've been a number of people. 
Nine of the signers of the Declaration of Independence were known to
be Freemasons. Ben Franklin, Robert
Treat Paine, John Hancock to name a
few. Thomas Jefferson and John
Adams were suspected members of the
order. George Washington wasn't a
signer, but he had access. He was
a 1st Master Mason. He was also a
surveyor and map-maker before he
was commander of the Continental
Army. He's got my vote.
IAN
Well, there is one way to see the
Declaration of Independence in
person.
RILEY
Really? How? 
IAN
We "borrow" it.
Ben laughs, incredulous. Ian pockets the pipe.
IAN (CONT'D)
Come on, Ben. The Lost Treasure of
the Knights of the Templar is the
treasure of all treasures. Gold
from the Temple of Solomon, King
Alaric II's ransom of the Athenians,
the entire wealth of 5th century
Rome, the Sword of Alexander the
Great. You've been looking for
this treasure all your life. You're
not going to let a piece of paper
stand in your way, are you?
BEN
You can't be serious.
IAN
What else are you going to do? Go
back to working on salvage crews? 
Comb beaches with a metal detector
looking for doubloons? Oh, that's
right. You have your PhD in History. 
Maybe you can teach high school
history.
National Treasure, 4/9/03 20.
46 CONTINUED: (5) 46
BEN
Forget it, Ian. I won't steal the
Declaration of Independence.
IAN
Don't get soft now. You begged me
to finance your expedition when
everyone else thought you were crazy. 
BEN
You financed this expedition because
you knew this treasure would make you
famous.
IAN
And, it will.
BEN
I won't let you.
IAN PULLS OUT HIS GUN from his belt. Trains it on Ben who
is STUNNED.
IAN
Oh, you didn't bring one of these? 
BEN
You're not going to shoot me, Ian. 
Not until you know all that I know
about the riddle.
Ian studies Ben. Is he bluffing?
IAN
Such as?
BEN
Put the gun away.
Ian turns his gun on Riley instead.
IAN
Tell me, or I shoot Riley.
RILEY
Wait! How do you know I don't know
something else about the riddle?!
Ben and Ian can't help but just give Riley a look, then Ian
pulls the trigger...BLAM! 
Riley flinches as the glass porthole in the wall just behind
him shatters. The old ship GROANS.
RILEY (CONT'D)
Shit. Come on, Ben. Tell him what
he doesn't know.
National Treasure, 4/9/03 21.
46 CONTINUED: (6) 46
BEN
Okay...
Ben comes up with HIS LIGHTER and flicks it on. 
BEN (CONT'D)
...for one thing, the whole room
below us is full of gunpowder. 
Ben holds the flame over the trap door in the floor.
BEN (CONT'D)
You shoot anyone, I drop this, and
none of us gets out of here alive.
Ian eyes the flame. Ben eyes the gun. A tense stand-off.
RILEY
(incredulous)
Whoa-whoa-whoa! How did we all go
from wildly rich to dead in a matter
of minutes? Let's think here.
Just then, the FLAME FLICKERS AND GOES OUT. Ian shrugs. 
On reflex, Ben tackles Riley and hurls them both to the
ground behind the desk as...
Ian OPENS fire on them...BLAM-BLAM-BLAM-BLAM-BLAM!
Bullets CHEW UP the desk and walls. 
One bullet takes out the GAS LANTERN. It explodes with an
OIL FIRE, instantly setting the desk ablaze.
47 INT. SHIP, UPPER COMPANIONWAY - CONTINUOUS 47
Ian hurries out of the cabin and battens the door shut.
48 INT. SHIP, CAPTAIN'S CABIN - CONTINUOUS 48
Flames spill down from the desk and creep across the floor. 
Ben tries the cabin door. It's locked. 
RILEY
We gotta put this fire out.
Riley tries to smother the fire. It's hopeless. Ben grabs
his ax and slams it into the door. Riley joins him. 
We PAN DOWN to the burning floor and PUSH through it into...
49 INT. SHIP, HIDDEN ROOM - CONTINUOUS 49
BURNING EMBERS fall from the ceiling, float to the floor,
catching a POWDER trail spilled on the ground. It ignites
and BURNS A PATH toward...the BARRELS OF GUNPOWDER.
National Treasure, 4/9/03 22.
50 INT. ICE CAVE, SHIP'S DECK - CONTINUOUS 50
Ian hurries across the tilted deck, calling to his men...
IAN
Get the hell out of here. It's
gonna blow!
Ian leaps off the deck, then runs with Shaw to the rope
ladders.
SHAW
I heard gunshots.
IAN
Gates and Riley tried to kill me.
51 INT. SHIP, HIDDEN ROOM - CONTINUOUS 51
The burning trail of gunpowder reaches the first barrel,
and the wood barrel CATCHES FIRE.
52 EXT. ARCTIC LANDSCAPE - CONTINUOUS 52
Shaw, Powell, and Shippen run like hell to their snowcats. 
Ian is the last man out of the hole in the ice, and he PULLS
UP THE ROPE LADDERS. 
Shaw climbs into a snowcat.
SHAW
Come on!
Ian jumps in with Shaw, and they all take off.
53 INT. SHIP, CAPTAIN'S CABIN - CONTINUOUS 53
An inferno. Portholes SHATTER as their panes shift. Ben
and Riley finally bust through the door and scramble out.
54 INT. SHIP, HIDDEN ROOM - CONTINUOUS 54
The BARREL OF GUNPOWDER burns, fully engulfed. 
55 INT. ICE CAVE, SHIP'S DECK - CONTINUOUS 55
Ben and Riley emerge from below and look across the way to
find that THE ROPE LADDERS are gone! They're trapped.
BEN
They pulled up the ladders.
Riley regards his surroundings, resigned.
RILEY
Why do I ever listen to you? I was
two credits away from graduation.
National Treasure, 4/9/03 23.
55 CONTINUED: 55
BEN
That was seven years ago.
Ben spots a SWIVEL CROSS-BOW HARPOON mounted on the deck
and hurries to it.
RILEY
Intel offered me a job with my own
cubicle.
Ben ties a rope to a spear and loads it into the harpoon.
BEN
Do we have to go over this every
expedition?
RILEY
Until I get rich, yes.
Ben wheels the harpoon around and aims it at Riley's head.
BEN
Fine. Now, duck!
Ben releases the harpoon...WHOOSH! The spear ROCKETS over
a ducking Riley up to the CAVE's ceiling. THUNK!
Ben grabs the ROPE. Pulls hard. The ice ceiling caves in,
opening a hole just above the ship's bow.
56 EXT. ARCTIC LANDSCAPE - CONTINUOUS 56
Ben and Riley clamber out of the ground just where the lady
figurehead pokes through the ice. They race to the Endeavor.
57 INTERCUT: The barrel of GUNPOWDER. It BLOWS...KA-BOOM! 57
58 INTERCUT: The arctic landscape. The ground shakes 58
violently. Ben and Riley dive into THE ENDEAVOR just as...
59 INTERCUT: The other barrels BLOW in a chain-reaction 59
series of explosions...BOOM-BOOM-BOOM-BOOM-BOOM!
60 EXT. ARCTIC LANDSCAPE - CONTINUOUS 60
A FIREBALL ERUPTS from the snow and ice. The CONCUSSION
launches THE ENDEAVOR forward off...
61 THE GLACIAL CLIFF! The Endeavor plummets down to... 61
62 EXT. ARCTIC OCEAN - CONTINUOUS 62
The Endeavor HITS THE WATER AND SINKS LIKE A ROCK as a
FIREBALL rolls skyward in the background. 
Burning SHARDS of WOOD rain down onto the icy waters. A
long beat, then...
National Treasure, 4/9/03 24.
62 CONTINUED: 62
WHOOSH! The Endeavor POPS BACK UP, floating on its pontoons.
63 INT. THE ENDEAVOR, FLOATING - CONTINUOUS 63
Riley laughs, incredulous.
RILEY
It drives! It flies! It floats! 
(looks around)
It needs a toilet.
Ben looks at the smoke and fire, solemn.
BEN
Ian's going to steal it.
RILEY
Why do you always have to focus on
the negative? You found Charlotte. 
That was your life's quest. Be
happy. I'm the one who should be
upset. I'm not wildly rich, which
is my life's quest.
BEN
Riley, it's the Declaration of
Independence.
RILEY
Do you see an American flag planted
in my ass? I didn't even vote in
the last election. I'm in this for
the money.
BEN
Well, if Ian gets the Declaration
of Independence, he gets the
treasure. All of it.
Riley considers that a beat, then...
RILEY
Suddenly I'm feeling very patriotic.
DISSOLVE TO:
64 EXT. THE MALL, WASHINGTON, D.C. - DAY 64
The famous green thoroughfare. There's the Lincoln Monument,
the Washington Monument, the White House. We TRAVEL down
Pennsylvania Avenue, finally coming to...
THE NATIONAL ARCHIVES. A beautiful neoclassical building.
65 CLOSE ON THE DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE. We are tight on 65
the autograph of JOHN HANCOCK. 
We PULL BACK to reveal...
National Treasure, 4/9/03 25.
66 INT. NATIONAL ARCHIVES, ROTUNDA - DAY 66
TOURISTS crowd around the Declaration of Independence
exhibit. Riley finishes counting the signatures.
RILEY
54...55...56.
(looks up, confused)
I don't get it. There are 56
signatures. The riddle said "55 in
iron pen."
BEN
The 56th signature, Thomas McKean's,
wasn't added until 1781, two years
after the Charlotte disappeared.
Riley looks to the document again, then shrugs...
RILEY
Well, it's still here. Looks like
Ian came to his senses.
GUARD (O.S.)
What're you doing?
They turn to find a GUARD standing behind them. He gestures
to the line of TOURISTS which snakes through the Rotunda.
GUARD (CONT'D)
You're holding up the line.
67 EXT. NATIONAL ARCHIVES - DAY 67
Ben and Riley exit the building.
RILEY
So, we're back. Let's go say "hi"
to your dad. Tell him that your
treasure hunting days are over. 
Just then, Ben grabs Riley and pulls him behind a column.
RILEY (CONT'D)
All right. I'm sorry. I know I'm
not supposed to talk about your dad.
Ben motions with his head, and Riley follows his gaze to... 
ACROSS THE STREET where Ian and Shaw climb into a SEDAN and
drive away. Riley watches them go, incredulous.
RILEY (CONT'D)
No way. They can't be doing this. 
This isn't some liquor store. It's
the National Archives. It's
impossible to break in.
National Treasure, 4/9/03 26.
67 CONTINUED: 67
BEN
Nothing's impossible. Ian will
hire an expert. Or pay off somebody
on the inside. Or both.
68 CLOSE ON the remains of a SHIPWRECK submerged in murky 68
water. A giant fish darts into frame. A goldfish. We
WIDEN to see we're in...
69 INT. BEN'S LOFT APARTMENT - DAY 69
A studio loft crowded with books, maps, a computer, SCUBA
gear, and many historical items, like a "Don't Tread on Me
Flag" which is framed but not hanging on the wall.
Keys jingle at the door, and it opens to Ben and Riley.
RILEY
I don't think we're safe here.
BEN
Ian thinks we're dead.
Suddenly, there's a noise outside the door. Ben grabs a
spear gun, and Riley whips open the door to reveal...
...a LADY. Actually, it's the LANDLADY (mid 50's) who greets
the spear gun pointed at her with a bored smile.
LANDLADY
This is why you can't keep a
girlfriend.
They sigh, relieved. Ben lowers the spear gun.
RILEY
Hello, Mrs. Doyle.
LANDLADY
Did you find it?
BEN
Yes.
RILEY
No.
She looks at Ben.
LANDLADY
You know when you talk about
Charlotte all the time, it scares
the girls away. That last girlfriend
you had was really nice too.
BEN
Don't worry. I won't be talking
about Charlotte ever again.
National Treasure, 4/9/03 27.
69 CONTINUED: 69
LANDLADY
Does that mean you're settling down
now?
RILEY
Yes.
BEN
No.
Ben digs into his pocket and comes up with the antique pocket
watch he found on the Charlotte.
BEN (CONT'D)
Here. I got something for you...
The Landlady inspects the watch, amazed.
BEN (CONT'D)
...It's 18th Century. French. 14K
gold key. Very rare.
LANDLADY
It's beautiful. Thank you.
Ben kneels down and starts rifling through his stacks of
books and maps and charts. She watches him.
LANDLADY (CONT'D)
You know, Ben, what you need to do
is stop reading so much, and go out
and have some fun.
BEN
You're right. We will.
Ben stands, holding a stack of books, and we CUT TO...
70 CUT TO CLOSE ON the books, which are now strewn across a 70
cherry wood desk. We WIDEN to reveal we're in...
71 INT. LIBRARY OF CONGRESS, READING ROOM - DAY 71
This 19th Century building is the grandest library in all
America. Ben and Riley study a SCHEMATIC at a table.
BEN
Every night, the Declaration of
Independence is lowered down into
the vault room which is directly
below the Rotunda...
CLOSE ON A BLUEPRINT of the National Archives. We FOLLOW
Ben's finger as it traces the path down through the Rotunda
floor and to the Vault Room right below.
BEN (CONT'D)
...where it's locked up in a
specially designed, impenetrable,
(MORE)
National Treasure, 4/9/03 28.
71 CONTINUED: 71
BEN (CONT'D)
50-ton, steel vault where it's
protected from heat, cold, even a
thousand years of nuclear winter. 
The entire process takes just two
minutes, but during those two
minutes, the Declaration of
Independence is vulnerable.
RILEY
So that's when Ian's going to do it?
BEN
Doubt it. A better time would be
to create a situation wherein the
Declaration would be automatically
lowered into its vault when the
guards aren't there.
RILEY
Well, Ian'd have to create some
external chaos because there's no
way he can hack in.
BEN
Why not?
RILEY
Because most of these old government
facilities use the old Data-Link
encryption-based security system. 
Once you're in, you can do whatever
you want, but only a handful of
people know how to get in.
BEN
And would one of those people happen
to be someone who gave up a good
life at Intel to help save his
country?
RILEY
Could be.
BEN
Then, it looks like we have the
edge.
RILEY
--Whoa-wait-whoa! Holy shit!
Riley's "holy shit" ECHOES LOUDLY through the room. ALL
HEADS turn to glare at them. Riley lowers his voice.
RILEY (CONT'D)
You just said "we."
National Treasure, 4/9/03 29.
71 CONTINUED: (2) 71
BEN
Yeah. As in me and you. 
RILEY
No. Nuh-uh. Bad idea.
BEN
What's bad? We take it first so
Ian can't steal it.
RILEY
You're right. That's not a bad
idea. It's an extremely-horribleget-your-ass-reamed-for-life-inprison idea.
BEN
It's the only way to protect it.
RILEY
How did we go from "let's stop Ian"
to "let's take it ourselves"?
BEN
You got a better idea?
RILEY
As a matter of fact, I do.
72 INT. NATIONAL ARCHIVES, OFFICE LOBBY - DAY 72
Ben and Riley wait. "DR. ABIGAIL CHASE, CHARTERS OF FREEDOM
CUSTODIAN" is stenciled on the office door.
BEN
You want me to do the talking?
RILEY
No, this is my idea. You'll try to
make it sound crazy.
Just then, a bookishly beautiful DR. ABIGAIL CHASE (26)
opens her office door. She sees Ben and Riley. 
ABIGAIL
Good afternoon, gentlemen. Please
come in.
Ben and Riley exchange a look. She's prettier than they
expected her to be.
73 INT. NATIONAL ARCHIVES, OFFICE - DAY 73
Abigail moves to her desk as Ben and Riley enter her office
which is decorated with colonial art and Revolutionary War
era artifacts.
National Treasure, 4/9/03 30.
73 CONTINUED: 73
RILEY
Thanks for seeing us on such short
notice, Dr. Chase. 
ABIGAIL
So, what can I do for you today?
Ben eyes Riley like, "go on."
RILEY
Okay. This is going to sound crazy,
but somebody's going to steal the
Declaration of Independence.
She regards them disdainfully. She gets this all the time.
ABIGAIL
All terrorist threats must be
reported directly to the FBI. Let
me get you their number.
She goes to get the number but is stopped by...
RILEY
This isn't a terrorist threat. The
people behind it are treasure hunters.
ABIGAIL
And they want to steal the
Declaration of Independence
because...?
Riley looks to Ben, but Ben looks away to a framed antique
button collection hanging on the wall.
RILEY
(reluctantly)
Because there's a treasure map on
the back.
ABIGAIL
Is this a joke?
RILEY
We just found proof in a ship that
was wrecked over 200 years ago.
ABIGAIL
I see. Well, I've seen the back of
the Declaration of Independence,
and I assure you, there is no map.
RILEY
Really? You sure?
ABIGAIL
Absolutely. I've seen it many times.
National Treasure, 4/9/03 31.
73 CONTINUED: (2) 73
BEN
Have you ever touched it?
ABIGAIL
Of course not. No one touches it. 
It's hermetically sealed in a bulletproof, thermopane case.
BEN
That must frustrate you. Seeing
something everyday and not being
able to touch it.
There's an undeniable charm about Ben, but Abigail does her
best to shrug it off.
ABIGAIL
I touch the case every day, which
is closer than most people will
ever get to it. Which makes me the
expert in this room about there
being or not being a map on the
back. Which there is not.
BEN
That's because it's invisible.
RILEY
It is?
BEN
Invisible inks were common back
then. They were used by both the
British and American armies to send
secret spy letters during the
Revolutionary War.
Abigail studies Ben, interest piqued.
BEN (CONT'D)
Or, the parchment could have been
palimpsest. Animal skin paper wasn't
exactly easy to make and was--
ABIGAIL
--often cleaned and reused. I know
what palimpsest is.
BEN
Of course, you do.
ABIGAIL
So, do you have any proof? About
this "invisible map"?
RILEY
It was in a riddle on an old pipe.
National Treasure, 4/9/03 32.
73 CONTINUED: (3) 73
ABIGAIL
May I see the pipe?
Ben and Riley exchange a look, then grudgingly...
RILEY
We don't have it.
ABIGAIL
Did Bigfoot take it?
RILEY
I told you it would sound crazy.
Ben straightens the framed collection.
ABIGAIL
Don't touch that, please.
Ben refers to an empty space in the button collection.
BEN
1789 George Washington Campaign
Buttons. All you need is the silverplated Inaugural Button to complete
the set. I found one of those once,
digging in a back yard in Maryland. 
You know, they're worth about five
thousand dollars.
ABIGAIL
(realizes)
You're treasure hunters as well.
BEN
Formerly. Now, we're more like
treasure protectors.
ABIGAIL
Well, Mr...?
Ben reaches out and shakes her hand.
BEN
Brown. Paul Brown. And this is my
friend, Tom Jeffries.
She shakes his hand.
ABIGAIL
Well, Mr. Brown and Mr. Jeffries,
let me assure you that the
Declaration of Independence is safe. 
We have a very sophisticated security
system designed to stop crazy people
like yourselves from getting near
it.
National Treasure, 4/9/03 33.
74 INT. NATIONAL ARCHIVES, CORRIDOR - DAY 74
Ben and Riley move down the corridor. 
RILEY
Paul Brown and Tom Jeffries?
BEN
When the Declaration of Independence
turns up missing, the Feds'll go
after anyone who reported it was
about to be stolen. Those are common
names. They should keep them busy
for a while. Buy us some time.
RILEY
So, we're really going to do it?
BEN
I am. I could use your help.
Ben pulls out a handkerchief and starts wiping his hand. 
RILEY
Once we get it, what are we going
to do with it?
BEN
Look at the back.
RILEY
We would?
BEN
Of course. If we don't look at the
back, we'll never find the treasure. 
If we don't find the treasure,
someone will always come looking
for the map, which means the
Declaration of Independence will
always be in danger until we find
the treasure.
Riley nods, liking Ben's reasoning.
RILEY
Then, we have to look at the back. 
It's our duty. As Americans.
Now, Riley notices Ben wiping his hand.
RILEY (CONT'D)
What's on your hand?
BEN
Ultra-violet ink. Dr. Chase has
daily access to the vault. I shook
her hand.
National Treasure, 4/9/03 34.
74 CONTINUED: 74
RILEY
You knew we were going to do this
all along, didn't you?
BEN
I was hoping she would believe us
so we wouldn't have to.
RILEY
Yeah. Me too.
75 CLOSE ON a woman's fingers as they quickly punch in a 75
passcode into a keyboard. A beat, then CLUNK. The
solenoid lock releases. We WIDEN to reveal...
76 INT. NATIONAL ARCHIVES, CORRIDOR - DAY 76
Abigail stands at the security entrance to the VAULT ROOM
with DR. STANLEY HERBERT (40s, suave intellectual).
DR. HERBERT
So, you need a ride tomorrow night? 
I could swing by. Pick you up.
He pushes through the heavy security door leading into...
77 INT. NATIONAL ARCHIVES, VAULT ROOM - CONTINUOUS 77
A high-tech room of concrete and steel. 
In the middle of the room, a 50-ton Mosler vault stands
open. A scissor-jack extends out of it and up to a steel
SLOT in the ceiling. Abigail and Dr. Herbert enter.
ABIGAIL
Dr. Herbert, if you came by to pick
me up, and we went to the gala
together, that would be like you
and me going on a date.
DR. HERBERT
It's more like car-pooling.
ABIGAIL
It's more like a date. And I don't
date co-workers.
DR. HERBERT
I'm not a co-worker. I'm your boss.
78 GRAINY SURVEILLANCE VIDEO OF THE SAME. We WIDEN to reveal 78
we're in...

ABIGAIL
Hi, Joe.
She opens a drawer, grabs a hand-held GAS CHROMATOGRAPHER.
ABIGAIL (CONT'D)
Ready whenever you are.
81 INTERCUT Woodruff. He grabs a key on the console... 81
WOODRUFF
This is why they pay me the big bucks.
He turns the key, and...
82 INT. NATIONAL ARCHIVES, VAULT ROOM - CONTINUOUS 82
The scissor-jack springs to life and starts to retract...
83 INT. NATIONAL ARCHIVES, ROTUNDA - DAY 83
Two GUARD patrolling the empty Rotunda watch as...
The DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE is lowered in its case from
its exhibit. We PUSH IN on it and FOLLOW it as...
84 THE SCISSOR-JACK retracts, pulling the DECLARATION OF 84
INDEPENDENCE through a steel slot in the FLOOR and into...
85 INT. NATIONAL ARCHIVES, VAULT ROOM - CONTINUOUS 85
As the scissor-jack retracts, the Declaration of Independence
descends in its case from the slot in the ceiling.
Abigail steps up to the document and waves the gas
chromatographer along the thermopane case's edges. The
instrument whizzes and hums, all apparently normal noises.
ABIGAIL
You ever wonder if there was
something on the Declaration of
Independence that might have been
overlooked?
DR. HERBERT
That document's been examined more
than a corn farmer on an alien space
ship. 
National Treasure, 4/9/03 36.
85 CONTINUED: 85
ABIGAIL
Everything we know of early
Archimedes came from palimpsest
overlooked for centuries.
The Declaration reaches the vault, then tips backwards.
DR. HERBERT
If you're angling for a grant, you're
going to have to come up with something better than that. You don't
want people to think you're crazy.
The Declaration lies back in the vault, then the 5-TON STEEL
VAULT DOORS slide closed with a LOUD THUNK as we CUT TO...
86 EXT. GREEN LINE SUBWAY STATION - DAY 86
Directly across the street from the National Archives.
87 INT. GREEN LINE SUBWAY STATION - DAY 87
Carrying a briefcase, Ben and Riley descend on an ESCALATOR
into this modern, spacious station. 
The platforms are crowded with COMMUTERS.
Ben and Riley step off the escalator and move through the
throng to the far end of the platform. Ben waits for the
train to pull away, then...
JUMPS DOWN ONTO THE TRACKS. Riley reluctantly follows.
88 INT. GREEN LINE SUBWAY TUNNEL - CONTINUOUS 88
Ben and Riley hurry along the tracks. The dim glow of a
flashlight lights only a few yards ahead of them. 
They finally come to a door bolted closed with a heavy lock
and stop. Ben pulls some bolt cutters out of the briefcase.
89 INT. GREEN LINE SUBWAY, UTILITY ROOM - LATER 89
Ben and Riley work in this cramped public works substation. 
Using a HAND-HELD ELECTRICAL SAW with a 2" circular blade,
Ben finishes cutting a hole in one of the many PVC pipes
that run along the ceiling of the substation.
Riley opens the briefcase and pulls out...
A TOY TRACTOR TRUCK, actually a sophisticated remote-operatedvehicle (ROV) with a camera taped to the hood. We CUT TO...
90 GOD'S EYE VIEW OF PENNSYLVANIA AVENUE. EVENING. 90
People, Cars. Buses. The National Archives on one side of
the street. The Green Line Subway Station on the other.
National Treasure, 4/9/03 37.
90 CONTINUED: 90
We PUSH down toward the pavement. Closer, closer, until we
butt up to it, then SEAMLESSLY MOVE through the pavement...
91 UNDERGROUND. We TRAVEL vertically through the layers of 91
concrete, rocks, dirt, concrete again. It opens up into...
92 A LABYRINTH OF PIPES, FIBER-OPTICS, GAS, ELECTRIC. We PUSH 92
INTO one pipe and MOVE seamlessly inside...
93 THE PIPE. We're moving in the direction of the National 93
Archives, finally catching up to the ROV. Its motor whirs. 
Its headlights play on a turn in the pipe ahead.
94 INT. GREEN LINE SUBWAY, UTILITY ROOM - LATER 94
Riley navigates the ROV with a JOYSTICK and a LAPTOP which
plays back what the ROV is seeing.
RILEY
What time is it?
BEN
Around five. Why?
RILEY
I'd be getting off work about now. 
At Intel.
ON THE SCREEN, the ROV arrives at an intimidating MATRIX OF
CONDUIT wrapped in a bunch.
RILEY (CONT'D)
There it is.
He punches a key on the laptop. Maneuvers the joystick.
95 IN THE PIPE. The ROV stops, extends a MECHANICAL ARM, 95
finds a red wire, and CLIPS ON TIGHT. With a WHOOSH...
96 We RUSH into the wire and TRAVEL, light-speed to... 96

RILEY
So, when are we doing this?
BEN
If we're going to beat Ian, we've
got to do it tomorrow night during
the gala. 
Ben gestures across the street to the National Archives. 
Red-white-and-blue Banners hang between the fluted columns,
announcing its 75th Anniversary Gala tomorrow night.
RILEY
There'll be hundreds of people there.
BEN
Hundreds of very important people. 
Any glitch in the system, and the
guards will have their hands full
protecting the dignitaries.
Riley considers that, then...
RILEY
I suppose while I'm hacking into
the Archives Security System, you'll
be needing me to get you on their
guest list as well.
BEN
You're talents would've been wasted
at Intel.
101 EXT. NATIONAL ARCHIVES - NIGHT 101
Pennsylvania Avenue is lined with limos and luxury sedans
as tuxedo'd MEN and WOMEN in designer gowns arrive.
102 INT. NATIONAL ARCHIVES, NORTH FOYER - NIGHT 102
GUESTS pass through metal detectors at the check-in.
103 INT. NATIONAL ARCHIVES, ROTUNDA - CONTINUOUS 103
A small STRING ORCHESTRA plays while hundreds of GUESTS
mingle in the Rotunda. Looking stunning in her sparkly
formal gown, Abigail stands with Dr. Herbert.
ABIGAIL
What do you think Thomas Jefferson
would say if he were here?
DR. HERBERT
He'd say, "Abigail, you need to
find a man of whom you are as
passionate about as you are of me... 
who's not dead."
National Treasure, 4/9/03 39.
103 CONTINUED: 103
We TRAVEL through the throng and come to a HEAVY-SET SENATOR
sipping wine. We CUT TO... 
104 VIDEO SURVEILLANCE OF THE SAME. We WIDEN to reveal... 104
105 INT. VAN - NIGHT 105
Riley sits in the back of this van, sipping coffee and
watching surveillance feeds on his laptop. 
ON THE SCREEN, he ZOOMS IN ON the FAT SENATOR.
RILEY
(sings to the tune of Santa
Claus is coming to Town)
"He sees you when you're drinking..."
He pans to a smarmy MAN flirting with a pretty LADY.
RILEY (CONT'D)
"He knows when you are cheating..."
He ZOOMS in until the pretty lady's butt fills the screen.
RILEY (CONT'D)
"...He knows when you left your
panties at home..."
As Riley zooms in on the butt, we transition to...
106 INT. NATIONAL ARCHIVES, ROTUNDA - NIGHT 106
The same LADY live in the Rotunda with the smarmy man. We
PAN across the crowd and finally find...
BEN, wearing a tuxedo and staring at the Declaration of
Independence.
MAN (O.S.)
Sir?
Ben turns to find a WAITER with a tray of champagne.
WAITER
Champagne?
Ben smiles and takes a glass of champagne. He then looks
to a SURVEILLANCE CAMERA mounted on the wall...
107 INT. VAN - NIGHT 107
ON THE LAPTOP SCREEN, Ben is looking right at Riley. He
tips his glass to him as he talks under his breath... 
BEN (ON SCREEN)
Here's to freedom.
National Treasure, 4/9/03 40.
107 CONTINUED: 107
Riley holds up his coffee cup and leans into a microphone.
RILEY
Our last night of it.
108 INT. NATIONAL ARCHIVES, ROTUNDA - NIGHT 108
They toast. Ben looks to the Declaration of Independence.
BEN
Maybe this is a bad idea.
RILEY (VIA MIC)
No, it's a good idea.
109 INTERCUT Riley. He studies the laptop screen. 109
BEN (VIA MIC)
We don't know about Ian. Not for
sure.
Riley spots something on the screen. Not good news.
RILEY
Yes, we do. He's here.
ON THE LAPTOP SCREEN, we now see Ian and his men unloading
a catering truck near the back entrance to the Archives.
110 INT. NATIONAL ARCHIVES, ROTUNDA - NIGHT 110
Ben moves purposefully across the Rotunda. 
ABIGAIL (O.S.)
What are you doing here?
Ben turns and sees Abigail. Tonight, she's simply
captivating. She takes Ben's breath away.
BEN
Dr. Chase...
ABIGAIL
Mr. Brown, I don't remember seeing
your name on the guest list.
BEN
I made a last minute donation.
111 INTERCUT Riley in the van, watching Ben and Abigail. 111
ABIGAIL (VIA MIC)
Shouldn't you be out robbing graves
or desecrating something?
RILEY
No time for mingling.
National Treasure, 4/9/03 41.
112 ON Ben and Abigail. 112
BEN
The night's still young.
Abigail can't help but smile at that. She eyes him. 
ABIGAIL
So, I've been wondering...what did
the riddle say?
BEN
The riddle?
ABIGAIL
On the pipe that Bigfoot took. 
Your friend said there was a riddle. 
What did it say?
Just then, Dr. Herbert arrives with two glasses of champagne.
DR. HERBERT
Abigail, your drink. 
Dr. Herbert hands Abigail a glass, not happy she's already
hooked up with somebody at the party. 
DR. HERBERT (CONT'D)
Who's your friend?
Ben reaches to shake his hand.
BEN
Paul Brown. And you must be Dr.
Herbert.
DR. HERBERT
You know me?
BEN
I referenced your paper on
Feudalistic Influence in the Southern
Colonies in my thesis.
DR. HERBERT
Oh, you're an academic?
BEN
Was.
113 INT. NATIONAL ARCHIVES, SECURITY STATION - NIGHT 113
Woodruff and the GUARDS watch the surveillance bay. 
We PUSH IN ON A MONITOR with a feed of the back service
entrance where the catering workers unload foodstuffs from
a truck. The POV pans back and forth as we CUT TO...
National Treasure, 4/9/03 42.
114 AN ARMOR DOME CAMERA doing its sweep. We WIDEN to see... 114
115 EXT. NATIONAL ARCHIVES, SERVICE ENTRANCE - NIGHT 115
Shaw waits for the camera to pan away, then aims a trickedout HV TASER GUN and FIRES...
BOOOSH! Two electrodes attached to insulated wires shoot
out of the gun at 100mph, latch onto the camera dome, then
pump 100,000 volts into the camera.
The camera sputters and sparks, shorted out.
116 INT. NATIONAL ARCHIVES, SECURITY STATION - NIGHT 116
The monitor CUTS TO SNOW. Woodruff gets on his radio.
WOODRUFF
Ferguson?
117 INT. NATIONAL ARCHIVES, SERVICE CORRIDOR - NIGHT 117
A GUARD patrolling the service corridor gets on his radio.
GUARD FERGUSON
Yeah?
WOODRUFF (VIA MIC)
We lost perimeter camera seven. Go
check it out.
118 INT. NATIONAL ARCHIVES, ROTUNDA - NIGHT 118
Ben stands with Abigail and Dr. Herbert. Ben looks around,
anxious.
DR. HERBERT
So, Mr. Brown, what brings you here
tonight?
BEN
High treason.
They regard Ben, curious.
BEN (CONT'D)
That's what the 56 men, by signing
the Declaration of Independence,
were committing. Had we lost the
war, they'd have been hanged,
beheaded, drawn and quartered, or
my personal favorite, had their
entrails cut out and burned while
they were still alive.
Ben grabs a drink off a passing tray and holds it up.
National Treasure, 4/9/03 43.
118 CONTINUED: 118
BEN (CONT'D)
In fact, let's toast them. To the
brave men who did what was considered
wrong in order to do what they knew
was right.
Dr. Herbert toasts enthusiastically. So does Abigail,
although more guardedly.
BEN (CONT'D)
Now, if you'll excuse me.
Ben leaves. Abigail watches him go, suspicious.
DR. HERBERT
Charming man. I liked him.
119 INT. NATIONAL ARCHIVES, SERVICE CORRIDOR - NIGHT 119
Guard Ferguson arrives at the back service entrance, stops,
and keys in his passcode.
120 EXT. NATIONAL ARCHIVES, SERVICE ENTRANCE - NIGHT 120
Guard Ferguson pushes open the door and is greeted by...
BOOOSH! The probes hit him square in his chest, and then a
surge of high voltage knocks him on his ass.
IAN and HIS MEN enter, stepping over the unconscious guard.
Ian shuts the service entrance. Shaw opens a BLACK DUFFEL
BAG. Grabs some duct tape and nylon rope. 
121 INT. VAN - NIGHT 121
The same snowy surveillance feed plays on Riley's laptop. 
RILEY
Ian took out the service entrance
camera. Ten-to-one he's inside
already. We should've done this
last night.
122 INT. NATIONAL ARCHIVES, RECORD OF AMERICA - NIGHT 122
Ben heads down the museum walkway, which is crowded with
gala guests. He talks sotto into his hidden mic.
BEN
Last night, the building was locked
down, like it is every night. That's
why we're doing it tonight.
RILEY (VIA MIC)
That's why Ian's doing it tonight too.
National Treasure, 4/9/03 44.
122 CONTINUED: 122
BEN
It's OK. I can beat him there.
Ben stops. Around the corner is a set of elevators. A
surveillance camera monitors the elevator foyer.
123 INTERCUT RILEY watching the feed of the elevator foyer. 123
BEN (VIA MIC)
Go.
On cue, Riley presses a key, and ON THE SCREEN, a new window
opens, so that there are two windows on the screen. Both
show an EMPTY elevator foyer.
RILEY
Zap! You're the Invisible Man.
He types a command and presses ENTER. 
124 We RUSH in on the ENTER key. Move light-speed, through the 124
computer, out the USB cable, up the antenna and into...
125 The tiny ANTENNA on the ROV which is still parked inside 125
the PIPE and patched into the security system...
126 INT. NATIONAL ARCHIVES, SECURITY STATION - NIGHT 126
GUARDS monitor the surveillance bay. There is a tiny hiccup,
barely noticeable, as the video of switches over.
WOODRUFF
Has Ferguson checked back in yet?
We PUSH IN on the empty foyer video and TRANSITION to...
127 INT. VAN - NIGHT 127
RILEY'S LAPTOP SCREEN, the same video plays in one of the
windows. It's a previously recorded loop of the EMPTY foyer. 
In the window, the loop is labeled "PLAYBACK." 
In the other window, the real surveillance feed of Ben in
the foyer plays. This feed is labeled "LIVE." 
128 INT. NATIONAL ARCHIVES, ELEVATOR - NIGHT 128
Ben steps onto the elevator, punches the "B" for basement
call button, and the elevator starts to descend.
BEN
You see Ian anywhere?
129 INTERCUT Riley checking surveillance feeds on his laptop. 129
RILEY
No. 
National Treasure, 4/9/03 45.
129 CONTINUED: 129
BEN (VIA MIC)
Let's do this.
Riley keys in a command on his keyboard. 
RILEY
OK. On my go, you have exactly--
130 INTERCUT Ben, setting the timer on his wristwatch. 130
BEN
--Two minutes. I know.
131 INT. NATIONAL ARCHIVES, STAIRWELL ACCESS - SIMULTANEOUSLY 131
Ian, Shaw, Powell, and Shippen move down a corridor to a
stairwell access door. On it, a sign reads, "ALARMED ENTRY. 
AUTHORIZED ACCESS ONLY." Ian looks to his men.
IAN
Time to take history.
He pulls out a REMOTE. Presses a button. A red light
FLASHES as we CUT TO...
132 INT. PENNSYLVANIA AVENUE - NIGHT 132
A STEEL TRANSFORMER BOX across the street from the National
Archives EXPLODES, showering the street in SPARKS and FIRE.
133 INT. NATIONAL ARCHIVES, ROTUNDA - NIGHT 133
In the Rotunda, the lights flicker and go out. The PARTY
GUESTS all react to the power outage.
134 INT. NATIONAL ARCHIVES, ELEVATOR - NIGHT 134
The elevator lights also flicker and go out, and the elevator
suddenly...JERKS TO A STOP!
135 INTERCUT RILEY in the van. ON HIS LAPTOP, the video feeds 135
all cut to snow.
RILEY
Shit-shit-shit! That wasn't me.
136 INTERCUT BEN in the elevator. He punches all of the call 136
buttons, but the elevator is stuck.
BEN
Ian blew a transformer.
137 INTERCUT Riley, realizing... 137
RILEY
A power outage will trigger the
emergency protocol. 
National Treasure, 4/9/03 46.
138 INTERCUT Ben. He starts his stopwatch. 138
BEN
That means the Declaration is on
its way down already.
He tries to pull open the elevator doors to no avail. He
looks around, mind ticking.
BEN (CONT'D)
Trigger the alarms. We gotta stop
Ian.
139 INTERCUT Riley. He stares at his laptop screen filled with 139
flashing security messages.
RILEY
The power outage already tripped
all the alarms. Everything's going
off. Guards won't know what's Ian
and what's not.
140 INT. NATIONAL ARCHIVES, SECURITY STATION - NIGHT 140
ON THE SURVEILLANCE BAY, every light is indeed blinking.
GUARD #1
Sir, we've lost surveillance and
main power.
GUARD #2
Emergency protocol's been initiated.
WOODRUFF
Switch to auxiliary, then reboot
and run a systems check.
141 INT. NATIONAL ARCHIVES, ROTUNDA - NIGHT 141
Murmurs sweep across the crowd of politicians as the
Declaration of Independence exhibit is automatically lowered
into the Rotunda flooring.
142 INT. NATIONAL ARCHIVES, SECURITY STATION - NIGHT 142
The guards frantically try to get their systems back up.
WOODRUFF
I want every available body on the
floor. Let's make sure our party
guests are safe.
143 INT. NATIONAL ARCHIVES, ROTUNDA - NIGHT 143
Auxiliary power kicks in, and the lights come back on. A
GUARD steps in to calm the crowd.
National Treasure, 4/9/03 47.
143 CONTINUED: 143
GUARD
We just had a little power outage,
but everything's under control. 
You'll notice the documents are
being lowered into their vaults,
but this is just standard procedure. 
They will be back shortly...
Abigail and Dr. Herbert exchange concerned looks.
144 INT. NATIONAL ARCHIVES, ELEVATOR - NIGHT 144
Ben slides a ceiling tile aside, but just then, the elevator
powers back up and starts descending again.
145 INTERCUT Riley in the van. He checks the stopwatch. 145
RILEY
96 seconds.
146 CUT TO CLOSE ON a THERMIC LANCE burning at 7000°F, cutting 146
through solid steel. We WIDEN to reveal... 
147 INT. NATIONAL ARCHIVES, STAIRWELL ACCESS - NIGHT 147
Shaw cuts through the SECURITY DOOR with the thermic lance. 
Ian checks his watch. A beat, Shaw finishes cutting through
the steel dead bolts, and the DOOR RELEASES...
148 INT. NATIONAL ARCHIVES, ROTUNDA - NIGHT 148
The orchestra starts playing again, and the waiters start
serving drinks, quelling the crowd. 
Abigail watches the Declaration of Independence disappear
from its exhibit. Her spider-senses are tingling.
149 INTERCUT THE DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE, moving by scissor 149
jack into the sub-flooring.
150 INT. NATIONAL ARCHIVES, STAIRWELL - NIGHT 150
Ian and his men charge down the stairs.
151 INT. NATIONAL ARCHIVES, INNER CORRIDOR - NIGHT 151
The elevator DINGS open, and Ben slips into this long
corridor. Ben moves quickly to... 
The huge steel VAULT ROOM DOOR at the end of the hall. 
There is a keyboard pad here, the same one Abigail punched
her passcode in earlier.
152 INTERCUT Riley in the van, watching the time tick down. 152
RILEY
57 seconds...
National Treasure, 4/9/03 48.
153 INTERCUT BEN. He pulls what looks like a THIN SLIDE VIEWER 153
out of his jacket pocket. He holds it over the keypad and
switches on its blue light...
THROUGH THE VIEWER GLASS, certain letters on the keypad
GLOW with ULTRAVIOLET FINGERPRINTS. Ben reads them...
BEN
A-E-F-G-L-O-R-V-Y.
154 INT. VAN - NIGHT 154
Riley keys the letters into an ANAGRAM GENERATOR on his
computer. The results scroll across the screen: A GLOVE
FRY, A VERY GOLF, A GROVE FRY, FARGO LEVY, GRAVY FLOWE.
RILEY
(reads from the screen)
"A glove fry, a very golf, Fargo
levy, gravy flowe, valey frog." 
Any of these make any sense?
155 INT. NATIONAL ARCHIVES, INNER CORRIDOR - NIGHT 155
Ben stares at the letters, realizes...
BEN
It's Valley Forge. She pressed "L"
and "E" twice.
He dons a WHITE GLOVE, then punches in the code, "Valley
Forge." A beat, then the VAULT ROOM DOOR unlocks with a
series of CLUNKS.
156 INT. NATIONAL ARCHIVES, STAIRWELL - NIGHT 156
Sweating, Shaw is now cutting through a second security
door with the thermic lance. 
SHAW
How much time?
Ian checks his watch.
IAN
We're right on schedule.
157 INT. NATIONAL ARCHIVES, VAULT ROOM - NIGHT 157
Ben jumps up on the vault. The scissor jack has completely
retracted, and the vault doors are starting to close. No
time to hesitate...
Ben lifts the Declaration of Independence (in its thermopane
case) out of the vault just as the steel doors close with a
loud THUNK.
National Treasure, 4/9/03 49.
158 INT. NATIONAL ARCHIVES, SECURITY STATION - NIGHT 158
The surveillance bay is aglow with flashing lights as the
system runs through its automatic checks. All the
surveillance screens are still snow.
159 INT. NATIONAL ARCHIVES, STAIRWELL - NIGHT 159
Shaw finishes cutting through. 
160 INT. NATIONAL ARCHIVES, INNER CORRIDOR - NIGHT 160
Carrying the Declaration in its case, Ben races back to the
elevator. He pushes the call button just as...
The stairwell access door OPENS, and through it emerge IAN,
SHAW, POWELL, and SHIPPEN. They surprised to see Ben's not
only alive, but he's got their quarry.
IAN
He's alive.
SHAW
Not for long.
SHAW OPENS FIRE on Ben with an automatic gun and silencer...
Ben whips the Declaration of Independence around, and USES
IT AS A SHIELD to protect himself.
The Declaration of Independence is ABSOLUTELY RIDDLED WITH
BULLETS! BLAM-BLAM-BLAM-BLAM-BLAM!
But the bullets BOUNCE OFF THE DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE'S
THERMOPANE CASE which is made of bullet-proof glass.
The force of the bullets knocks Ben into the ELEVATOR as it
DINGS OPEN...
Ian suddenly grabs Shaw's arm. His shots go astray, raking
the metal elevator doors which finally close.
IAN
What's the matter with you?! You'll
damage the map!
161 INT. NATIONAL ARCHIVES, ELEVATOR - CONTINUOUS 161
Ben falls inside, then bangs on the call-button panel.
162 INTERCUT Riley in the van. He's heard the commotion. 162
RILEY
Ben? Ben?! 
BEN (VIA MIC)
I got it.
National Treasure, 4/9/03 50.
162 CONTINUED: 162
We can now hear SIRENS approaching.
RILEY
You'd better hurry.
163 INTERCUT BEN IN THE ELEVATOR. He sets the case down and 163
pulls two DROPPERS OF VISINE out of his pants pocket.
BEN
You'd better not leave.
Ben takes one of the droppers and carefully drops a single
DROP on each of the four bolts in the corners of the
Declaration of Independence's case.
Ben then grabs the second DROPPER OF VISINE and drops a
second set of drops on the bolts. When the two drops of
liquid combine, the BOLTS BEGIN TO SMOKE AND SMOLDER. 
Ben checks the elevator panel. The elevator ascends...
BEN (CONT'D)
(to the chemicals)
Come on...come on...
164 INT. NATIONAL ARCHIVES, STAIRWELL - NIGHT 164
Ian and his men charge back up the stairs...
165 INT. NATIONAL ARCHIVES, CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS 165
...and burst into the empty corridor.
166 INT. NATIONAL ARCHIVES, ELEVATOR - NIGHT 166
The SMOLDERING dissipates, and Ben pulls the case apart. 
The argon gas vents from the interior with a HISS-WHOOSH!
Ben gingerly lifts the precious document out, quickly rolls
it up, then pulls a HEAVY-DUTY, CLEAR PLASTIC CYLINDRICAL
BAGGIE out of his jacket pocket...
...and carefully SLIPS THE DOCUMENT INTO THE BAGGIE. 
167 INT. NATIONAL ARCHIVES, SECURITY STATION - NIGHT 167
Woodruff watches as one-by-one, the monitors on the

National Treasure, 4/9/03 51.
169 INT. NATIONAL ARCHIVES, NORTH FOYER - CONTINUOUS 169
Ben rounds the corner and casually melts into the crowd. 
He heads for the exit, but just a few yards ahead is...
ABIGAIL. Ben ducks into...
170 INT. NATIONAL ARCHIVES, GIFT SHOP - CONTINUOUS 170
GALA GUESTS peruse the souvenirs. Head down, Ben watches
as Abigail passes by outside the gift shop window. He waits
a beat, then moves to exit. But he's stopped by...
WOMAN (O.S.)
Hey, sir!
Ben looks up. The CLERK working the register regards him.
CLERK
You trying to steal that?
Ben looks down and realizes the Declaration of Independence
is poking out of his jacket. He's busted. Then...
He notices he's standing next to a bin filled with "ACTUAL
SIZE DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE Reproductions." Each one
wrapped in heavy plastic just like the real one.
CLERK (CONT'D)
It's $35.00.
BEN
$35?! It's just a piece of paper.
He digs into his pockets and comes up with several rumpled
bills and coins. He quickly counts them out, but...
BEN (CONT'D)
I only have $32.57.
CLERK
We take ATM and credit cards.
171 INT. NATIONAL ARCHIVES, SERVICE CORRIDOR - NIGHT 171
GUARDS search the corridor but find no sign of Ferguson. 
172 INT. NATIONAL ARCHIVES, SECURITY STATION - NIGHT 172
GUARD (VIA RADIO)
I can't find Ferguson.
Woodruff is distressed by the news. 
WOODRUFF
This isn't good.
National Treasure, 4/9/03 52.
172 CONTINUED: 172
CUT TO QUICK SHOTS, RAPID FIRE:
173 We FOLLOW GUARDS' FEET sprinting down the inner corridor. 173
174 A GUARD PUNCHES HIS PASSCODE INTO THE VAULT KEYPAD. 174
175 THE GUARDS PUSH OPEN THE VAULT DOOR... 175
176 IN THE FOYER, Ben pushes by guests, almost to the exit... 176
177 IN THE SECURITY STATION, Woodruff turns the key on the 177
console and prays...
WOODRUFF
Please be there...please God, let
it be there...
178 EXT. NATIONAL ARCHIVES - NIGHT 178
Carrying the "souvenir," Ben hurries down the sidewalk in
front of the National Archives.
ABIGAIL (O.S.)
Hey!
Abigail catches up to him, but Ben keeps moving.
ABIGAIL (CONT'D)
What's that?
BEN
What's what?
179 EXT. NATIONAL ARCHIVES, SERVICE ENTRANCE - NIGHT 179
Ian and his men burst out the back service exit. 
180 INT. NATIONAL ARCHIVES, VAULT ROOM - NIGHT 180
The vault's steel doors slide open, revealing the bad news... 
THE DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE IS GONE! 
181 INT. NATIONAL ARCHIVES, SECURITY STATION - NIGHT 181
Woodruff sees the empty vault on the surveillance screen. 
He hits the ALARM and gets on his radio.
WOODRUFF
Code Red. Code Red. We have a
break in! Lock it down. Nobody
leaves the building.
Woodruff looks around. He can't believe this is happening.
WOODRUFF (CONT'D)
Somebody get the FBI on the phone! 
Now!
National Treasure, 4/9/03 53.
182 EXT. CONSTITUTION AVENUE - NIGHT 182
Abigail follows Ben as he hurries across the street.
ABIGAIL
What's that? That in your hand.
BEN
A souvenir. Got it at the gift
shop.
They reach the van, where Riley waits, engine running.
RILEY
Let's go!
Just then, the National Archives ALARMS SOUND! Abigail's
face falls. She knows what Ben has done.
ABIGAIL
You didn't.
BEN
You wouldn't understand.
Ben reaches for the van door, but Abigail SCREAMS...
ABIGAIL
POLICE!
Ben panics, grabs her, covers her mouth, but she BITES him
and...COMES UP WITH THE DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE.
183 EXT. NATIONAL ARCHIVES, SERVICE ENTRANCE - NIGHT 183
As Ian and his men climb into their catering truck, Ian
sees...
Ben standing across the street with Abigail who is holding
the Declaration of Independence.
184 EXT. CONSTITUTION AVENUE - NIGHT 184
Abigail looks at the rolled up parchment, incredulous.
BEN
Careful with that!
ABIGAIL
Oh. My. God.
Riley sees she has IT now and puts his head in his hands.
RILEY
(sotto)
Oh my God.
National Treasure, 4/9/03 54.
184 CONTINUED: 184
BEN
(to Abigail)
You're making a big mistake--
ABIGAIL
--You weren't protecting it. You're
stealing it.
BEN
Listen. There are some very bad
people, people who don't care about
the Declaration of Independence,
people who only see it as a map.
ABIGAIL
You're pathetic.
With that, she turns and starts crossing the street, the
Declaration of Independence in her hand.
Ben hurries to get into the van.
BEN
Come on. Let's go.
Riley watches Abigail leaving with the Declaration.
RILEY
But. You can't just let her go.
BEN
Yes, we can. 
Suddenly, the CATERING TRUCK barrels down on Abigail in the
middle of the street. She side-steps out of its way, but
it SCREECHES TO A STOP in front of her, blocking her path.
Ben sees the truck's driver...it's Shippen.
BEN (CONT'D)
Oh no.
The truck's back doors burst open, and Ian, Shaw, and Powell
jump out and swarm Abigail. She struggles like a wild cat. 
Ben moves to help her, but Powell opens fire on him, sending
Ben diving for cover behind the van.
185 INT. VAN - NIGHT 185
Riley ducks as the van is raked with bullets. The van's
windows shatter. Glass shards pepper the interior.
186 EXT. CONSTITUTION AVENUE - NIGHT 186
Ian and Shaw throw Abigail into the back of the truck. 
Powell jumps into the cab, and the truck peels out.

IAN
Give it to me.

A dozen POLICE CARS speed by them, going the other way,
toward the National Archives.
191 INT. CATERING TRUCK, MOVING - NIGHT 191
The truck veers suddenly, sending Abigail on her ass. Ian
snatches the Declaration of Independence out of her hand as
she stumbles.
192 EXT. 3RD STREET - NIGHT 192
A scenic street if anyone had time to look. The U.S. Capitol
on one side, the Washington Monument on the other.

195 CONTINUED: 195
Ian ignores her. Slips the document from its cover.
SHAW
What do we do with her?
Ian starts unrolling the document. Doesn't look up.
IAN
No witnesses.
Shaw turns his gun on Abigail. Abigail's eyes search the
truck. Looking for a way out...
196 INT. VAN, MOVING - NIGHT 196
Riley pulls alongside the driver's side of the catering
truck, then he YANKS the wheel hard...
197 EXT. FREEWAY ON-RAMP - NIGHT 197
The van SLAMS into the catering truck just as...
198 INT. CATERING TRUCK, MOVING - NIGHT 198
Shaw cocks his gun, squeezes the trigger, but the truck
shakes violently ON IMPACT, sending Shaw on his ass. 
Abigail scrabbles to the truck's back doors, but they're
latched shut. 
Irked, Shaw moves to finish her off. But just then, Ian
notices something about the document that makes him go...
IAN
Wait.
Ian looks up, then turns the document to Abigail.
IAN (CONT'D)
What the hell is this?
Abigail looks at the document, and is just as surprised as
Ian. Stamped on the document is a PRICE TAG. She grins.
ABIGAIL
A souvenir.
199 EXT. INTERSTATE 395 - NIGHT 199
The van slaloms traffic and pulls alongside the truck.
200 INT. CATERING TRUCK, MOVING - NIGHT 200
Ian looks to Abigail, who stands by the truck's back doors.
IAN
Who are you?
National Treasure, 4/9/03 57.
200 CONTINUED: 200
Abigail talks, she reaches behind her back and
surreptitiously unlatches the door latch...
ABIGAIL
(stalling)
I'm Dr. Abigail Chase, Executive
Custodian of the Charters of Freedom
for the National Archives.
201 INT. VAN, MOVING - NIGHT 201
Ben moves to the back of the van and slides open the van's
side door.
202 INT. CATERING TRUCK CAB, MOVING - NIGHT 202
Shippen sees Ben in the van and whips the steering wheel...
203 EXT. INTERSTATE 395 - NIGHT 203
The catering truck YAWS into the van.
204 INT. CATERING TRUCK, MOVING - NIGHT 204
Abigail finally manages to unlatch the latch.
ABIGAIL
Who are you--
Just then, the truck is rocked as it SLAMS into the van. 
Ian and Shaw are buried by a cascade of chafing dishes.
The truck's back doors to SWING OPEN WILDLY. Abigail just
manages to grab the latch, and she ARCS OUT INTO traffic.
205 EXT. INTERSTATE 395 - NIGHT 205
A TOUR BUS motors along in the heavy D.C. traffic, passing
the Jefferson Memorial, beautifully lit at night.
206 INT. TOUR BUS, MOVING - NIGHT 206
A GROUP OF TOURISTS crane their necks out their windows as
a TOUR GUIDE zealously describes the sights.
TOUR GUIDE
...And over to your right, you can
see the Jefferson Memorial. Who
can tell me what important document
Thomas Jefferson authored?
Nobody answers. Instead, they're all glued to the action...
207 EXT. INTERSTATE 395 - NIGHT 207
Abigail dangles off the door, both hands gripping the latch.
National Treasure, 4/9/03 58.
208 EXT. VAN, MOVING - NIGHT 208
Riley maneuvers the van up to the back of the catering truck. 
Ben holds onto the door frame and reaches out to Abigail.
BEN
Grab my hand!
Holding on for dear life, she looks to Ben like he's crazy.
ABIGAIL
With what?!
209 INT. VAN, MOVING - NIGHT 209
Riley fights the wheel, holding steady. Looks ahead to see
A TRAFFIC JAM. Total gridlock. A sea of red brake lights.
RILEY
Uh...hurry!
210 EXT. VAN, MOVING - NIGHT 210
Ben reaches for Abigail.
BEN
Come on!
Abigail summons up her courage, lets go of one hand, and
SWINGS toward Ben. Their fingers almost touch... 
211 INT. VAN, MOVING - NIGHT 211
But there's no more room to go. Riley brakes...
212 EXT. INTERSTATE 395 - NIGHT 212
The van and Ben suddenly decelerate away from Abigail who
almost falls.
213 INT. CATERING TRUCK CAB, MOVING - NIGHT 213
The van falls back, and Shippen looks ahead and sees why...
PARKED CARS locked in traffic. Shippen SLAMS on the brakes.
214 EXT. INTERSTATE 395 - NIGHT 214
The catering truck tires BURN RUBBER.
215 INT. CATERING TRUCK, MOVING - NIGHT 215
The sudden stop sends Ian and Shaw asses over elbows. 
The truck's doors SWING ABIGAIL BACK INSIDE, then close
behind her. Abigail's now back in the truck in front of an
angry firing squad. Shaw turns his gun on her...
National Treasure, 4/9/03 59.
216 EXT. INTERSTATE 395 - NIGHT 216
Ben hurries to the back of the catering truck and yanks the
handle just as...
217 INT. CATERING TRUCK - NIGHT 217
Shaw SHOOTS! But Abigail disappears as the truck door swings
open again.
The errant bullets blow out the windshield of AN ONCOMING
TANKER TRUCK. 
The tanker truck driver yanks the wheel hard and slams on
his brakes.
218 EXT. INTERSTATE 395 - NIGHT 218
The tanker truck JACK-KNIFES...
219 INT. CATERING TRUCK - NIGHT 219
Ian and Shaw watch in horror as the jack-knifed tanker truck
slews uncontrollably toward them. 
They dive out of the truck.
220 INT. CATERING TRUCK CAB - NIGHT 220
Shippen lays on his HORN, not seeing what Powell sees in
his rearview mirror....the runaway juggernaut.
221 EXT. INTERSTATE 395 - NIGHT 221
POWELL and other MOTORISTS SCRAMBLE out of their cars,
DUCKING and DIVING out of the way of the TANKER TRUCK... 
...which SHIPPEN finally sees. Too late. 
THE TANKER TRUCK CRASHES INTO THE BACK OF THE CATERING
TRUCK...WHAM-SMASH-CRUNCH! 
EACH CAR IN FRONT OF THE CATERING TRUCK PLOWS INTO THE CAR
in front of it. Metal crumples, glass shatters, tires POP.
IAN, SHAW, and POWELL come up from the smoking mayhem. Ian
looks down the shoulder where he sees...
BEN and RILEY'S VAN blow past the pile-up. The van pulls
off an off-ramp and disappears.
IAN
Piss!
222 INT. VAN, MOVING - NIGHT 222
Riley drives, pedal to the metal. Ben sits in the back
with a flustered Abigail.
National Treasure, 4/9/03 60.
222 CONTINUED: 222
BEN
You all right?
ABIGAIL
No, I'm not all right! Where's the
Declaration of Independence?
She immediately starts searching the van. Riley glances in
the rearview mirror and sees her searching the van.
RILEY
What do you mean "where is it"? 
You had it!
ABIGAIL
I didn't have it. He gave me a
fake.
Riley looks to Ben, surprised.
RILEY
You did? 
(between his teeth)
Then, why'd we go after her, Ben?
ABIGAIL
Ben? I thought your name was Paul.
BEN
I had to lie. My real name is Ben
Gates. Benjamin Franklin Gates.
ABIGAIL
I'm supposed to believe that?
BEN
Being named after one of America's
founding fathers is sort of like a
tradition in my family. 
RILEY
An obsession, actually.
ABIGAIL
Where is the real the Declaration
of Independence?
BEN
Don't worry. It's safe.
Abigail stops searching. Eyes him.
ABIGAIL
So you did steal it.
BEN
If I hadn't, those men would have.
National Treasure, 4/9/03 61.
222 CONTINUED: (2) 222
ABIGAIL
Give it to me. I have to return it.
BEN
I can't let you do that. That guy
who tried to kill you will just
come after it again. 
ABIGAIL
We'll warn the authorities. They'll
protect it.
BEN
Like they did tonight?
223 EXT. NATIONAL ARCHIVES - NIGHT 223
The building is now cordoned off and swarming with POLICE.
224 INT. NATIONAL ARCHIVES, NORTH FOYER - NIGHT 224
MEN and WOMEN in FBI blazers enter with Woodruff. Leading
the group is SADUSKY (40s), solidly built, a complete pro.
SADUSKY
What're we dealing with?
WOODRUFF
A break-in.
225 INT. NATIONAL ARCHIVES, ROTUNDA - NIGHT 225
The detained guests wait impatiently in the Rotunda. Sadusky
and his team enters and take charge of the room.
SADUSKY
All right, my name is Sadusky. I
am Agent In Charge. I want this
building cleared and sealed off. 
Security clearance only.
Sadusky turns to a female agent, AGENT DAWES.
SADUSKY (CONT'D)
A complete list of names of everyone
on tonight's guest list and their
dates. Find out who's NOT here.
Agent Dawes peels off, and Sadusky turns to AGENT JOHNSON.
SADUSKY (CONT'D)
The vault and lobby security logs
and all the surveillance tapes for
the last 30 days.
Agent Johnson nods and peels off, and Sadusky turns to two
more agents, AGENT COLFAX and AGENT HENDRICKS.
National Treasure, 4/9/03 62.
225 CONTINUED: 225
SADUSKY (CONT'D)
The cars in the underground parking
garage. Find any not accounted for.
Colfax and Hendricks leave, and Sadusky turns to Woodruff.
SADUSKY (CONT'D)
I want the names and shift schedules
of everybody with access to the
building. From the janitors to the
curator.
WOODRUFF
Yes, sir.
SADUSKY
Now, Mr. Woodruff, if you can please
tell me what exactly was taken?
Woodruff gulps, can barely choke out the words...
226 INT. VAN, MOVING - NIGHT 226
Riley pulls onto a highway. 
ABIGAIL
There's no map on the back of the
Declaration of Independence.
BEN
Ever heard of the Templar Knights? 
ABIGAIL
They were a military order of the
Catholic Church dissolved by the
Pope in the 14th century.
BEN
After King Philip of France had
them all burned at the stake.
ABIGAIL
That's only a legend.
BEN
The Templar Knights are what legends
are made of. Noble men with no
allegiance to any state or ruler. 
Their cause was to protect innocent
people from tyrannical rulers and
oppression. In 1307, they broke
into a Visigothic stronghold in
Languedoc, France and found a
treasure so massive it took six
days to exhume. They had taken a
vow of poverty and swore to protect
the treasure, using it only for the
(MORE)
National Treasure, 4/9/03 63.
226 CONTINUED: 226
BEN (CONT'D)
noblest purpose. King Philip wanted
the treasure...if he could only
find it. He had the Knights arrested
and tortured, but none ever confessed
to the treasure's whereabouts. The
few Knights who'd evaded capture
hid the treasure for almost 200
years, then finally brought it to
the one place where there were no
kings and no religious persecution,
the New World. Christopher Columbus,
not so coincidentally, was a
descendant of the Knights.
ABIGAIL
What do the Templar Knights have to
do with the Declaration?
Ben pulls a one-dollar bill out of his pocket and points to
the symbols on the back.
BEN
The all-seeing eye. The unfinished
pyramid. These are the marks of
the Templar. Our founding fathers
were descendants of the Knights. 
They put the map on the back.
Abigail just looks at Ben. An incredulous beat, then...
ABIGAIL
This is crazy. I'm calling the
police. Stop the car.
Riley doesn't slow down.
ABIGAIL (CONT'D)
You wish to add kidnapping to your
list of federal offenses?
RILEY
You can get out whenever you want.
Abigail glances out the window. They're going about 70mph.
ABIGAIL
Fine. I will!
She reaches for the door handle.
BEN
Do you still want to hear the riddle
from the pipe?
That stops Abigail. She turns him, listening.
National Treasure, 4/9/03 64.
226 CONTINUED: (2) 226
BEN (CONT'D)
"The legend writ, the stain effected
The key in Silence undetected
Fifty-five in iron pen 
Mr. Matlack can't offend."
ABIGAIL
Timothy Matlack? The calligrapher
of the Declaration of Independence?
BEN
The pipe came from Mt. Vernon.
Abigail digests this, incredulous.
ABIGAIL
If that's true, the pipe is a major
American historical find.
BEN
Yeah well, Ian already has it, and
he'll take the Declaration too if
we don't protect it.
ABIGAIL
How do I know you're not lying? 
BEN
We look at the back. 
Abigail considers that, then looks Ben square in the eye.
ABIGAIL
All right. But if there's nothing
on the back, you're turning
yourselves in.
BEN
Deal. Because if there's nothing
on the back, the Declaration's safe.
227 INT. NATIONAL ARCHIVES, SERVICE CORRIDOR - NIGHT 227
Two EMTs work on Guard Ferguson who is conscious now. He
sits propped up against a wall, talking to Agent Dawes.
GUARD FERGUSON
The only thing I remember is the
smell of my hair burning.
ON SADUSKY who approaches. Agent Dawes nods to Guard
Ferguson, then joins Sadusky down the hall.
AGENT DAWES
They got him with a taser gun at
the service entrance. 
National Treasure, 4/9/03 65.
227 CONTINUED: 227
SADUSKY
Did he see the shooter? Anything?
Agent Dawes shakes her head, no.
228 INT. NATIONAL ARCHIVES, INNER CORRIDOR - NIGHT 228
FBI forensics TECHNICIANS work the crime scene, studying
bullet casings and dusting for fingerprints. Sadusky moves
down the corridor with Dr. Herbert and Woodruff.
SADUSKY
Rounds were fired, and nobody heard
anything?
WOODRUFF
The vault corridor is lined with
three feet of steel and concrete.
Sadusky studies the walls pocked with bullet holes.
SADUSKY
We get a description from the guards?
WOODRUFF
Which guards?
SADUSKY
The guards that were fired upon.
WOODRUFF
There were no guards on patrol down
here.
Sadusky moves to the elevator which is also bullet-riddled.
SADUSKY
Then, who were the thieves shooting
at?
Just then, Agent Colfax calls from the stalled elevator.
AGENT COLFAX (O.S.)
Found it!
Sadusky, Woodruff and Dr. Herbert move to... 
THE ELEVATOR. Agent Hendricks stands above the elevator
car in the shaft. He hands THE EMPTY THERMOPANE DISPLAY
CASE down to Agent Colfax from its hiding place.
AGENT HENDRICKS
Looks like they used a dibasic acid
to dissolve the bolts.
Dr. Herbert looks so broken up, he just might cry.
National Treasure, 4/9/03 66.
228 CONTINUED: 228
SADUSKY
Get a copy of the Declaration in
place before opening tomorrow.
DR. HERBERT
Yes, absolutely.
SADUSKY
No word goes to the public. 
Everything is to appear normal. 
Dr. Herbert does his best to compose himself.
DR. HERBERT
Who would do such a thing?
AGENT HENDRICKS
Anti-government terrorists. 
Just then, Agent Johnson steps up.
AGENT JOHNSON
Computerized security records
indicate that a Dr. Abigail Chase
accessed the vault at 9:32pm tonight.
DR. HERBERT
Dr. Chase? Impossible. I was with
her at that time.
Agent Johnson shows Sadusky a copy of Abigail's ID photo.
SADUSKY
Who is she?
DR. HERBERT
The Charters of Freedom Custodian.
AGENT JOHNSON
The one in charge of the Declaration
of Independence.
SADUSKY
Where is she? Let's talk to her.
AGENT JOHNSON
Unaccounted for, sir.
Dr. Herbert is upset by the news. Now, Agent Dawes
approaches, carrying a computer printout.
AGENT DAWES
A man named Benjamin Gates used his *
credit card in the gift shop at
9:39pm. He wasn't on the guest list. *
We got an address from the credit *
card company. *
National Treasure, 4/9/03 67.

SADUSKY *
Gift shop? What the hell did this *
guy buy?
229 INT. VAN, MOVING - NIGHT 229*
Ben roots around under the seat. Comes up with a Big-Gulp *
cup. Tosses it aside. Finally comes up with a cardboard *
mailing tube. He peels off an old cheeseburger wrapper
stuck to it, then hands it to Abigail. *
BEN *
Here.
Abigail opens the tube and partially pulls out the document. 
The aged parchment is clearly visible through the plastic. 
She's awe-struck. 
ABIGAIL
You are not to touch this ever again!
She slips the document back inside the tube.
BEN
Fine by me. I never wanted to touch
it in the first place.
ABIGAIL
You don't deserve to touch it.
RILEY
Let's just look at the map. That
way nobody will ever have to touch
it again.
ABIGAIL
Not here.
RILEY
What do you mean "not here"?
ABIGAIL
Not in the back of a van. We'll
need chemicals. A controlled
environment. A clean room with
particulate air filtration. ESD
attire. I hope you have all that.
230 CUT TO - A DOOR BURSTS OPEN, and a SWAT TEAM swarms in, all 230*
in black, bullet-proof gear, helmets, lights, guns. We
WIDEN to reveal that we're in...
231 INT. APARTMENT - NIGHT 231
Shrouds of plastic hang over the windows. Beams of light
cut through the darkness as the team moves swiftly through

SWAT COP
Interior secure!
232 INT. APARTMENT BUILDING CORRIDOR - NIGHT 232
Sadusky and his team move down the hallway. Agent Dawes
reads from a printout.
AGENT DAWES
Ben Franklin Gates used his Visa on
a one-way plane ticket from Toronto
to D.C. two days ago after spending
seven months unaccounted for. Before
that, his paper trail's got him all
over the place. Boston, France,
Boston, Greenland.
AGENT COLFAX
The landlady didn't want to say
much about him. Only that he's
rarely here, that he's very nice,
and that he always pays his rent,
sometimes months in advance. 
They come to a room cordoned off and guarded by police.
AGENT COLFAX (CONT'D)
Wait 'til you see this.
233 INT. BEN'S LOFT APARTMENT - NIGHT 233
Sadusky and his team enter the room and stop suddenly at
what they see. We REVERSE and find...
We're in Ben's apartment, and everything is now all lined
in plastic. Every square inch of the room. The windows,
walls, carpet, television, and all of the furniture. 
A CHEMISTRY SET sits on the dresser. A box of BLUE ESD
BOOTIES sit near the door. The only other thing not covered
is a Xerox copied collection of old handwritten letters. 
Agent Dawes dons a pair of gloves, picks them up, and studies
the letters.
AGENT DAWES
Letters to the editor of The NewEngland Courant. Written in 1722.
She flips through the other letters.
AGENT DAWES (CONT'D)
They're all from the same person.
(reads a letter)
"Your humble servant, Silence
Dogood."
Agent Hendricks studies the blue booties by the door.
National Treasure, 4/9/03 69.
233 CONTINUED: 233
AGENT HENDRICKS
What's this guy up to?
AGENT JOHNSON
Profilers say we're looking at an
adult male, a loner, has a high IQ
but has never been able to hold
down a job, is socially inept, has
probably written numerous letters
to the White House expressing antigovernment sentiments. We're
expecting him to contact us shortly
with ransom demands.
Sadusky eyes the "Don't Tread on Me" Flag which is covered
in clear plastic. 
SADUSKY
I don't think he's going to be
calling with any ransom demands.
234 CUT TO - A BOTTLE OF SAMUEL ADAMS beer is slammed down onto 234
a table. We WIDEN to reveal...
235 INT. HAWK AND DOVE RESTAURANT - NIGHT 235
Powell and Shaw sit with Ian who studies the pipe. 
SHAW
Where do you think they went?
No response. Ian turns the pipe over, then looks to a
cocktail napkin on which he's written the riddle.
ON THE NAPKIN, the words "legend" and "key" are underlined
along with "undetected" and "Silence."
IAN
That bastard. He did know something
he wasn't telling me. Look at this.
(points to a line) *
"Legend" and "key" are not the same *
thing. "Legend" means map. "Key
means key.
POWELL
The key to the treasure?
IAN
During the war, generals used secret
codes and ciphers to disguise their
communications. To decode the
cipher, the recipient needed the
"key," like a book or an old letter. *
"The key in Silence undetected." *
You know why Silence is capitalized?
Powell and Shaw exchange a look, then hazard a guess...
National Treasure, 4/9/03 70.
235 CONTINUED: 235
SHAW
Because...it's important?
IAN
Because it's a name.
236 INT. VAN, MOVING - NIGHT 236
Ben and Abigail look ahead to see a SEA OF POLICE AND FBI
in the parking lot of Ben's apartment building.
RILEY
What do we do now?
ABIGAIL
Turn yourselves in.
BEN
Go to Hillcrest.
RILEY
(scoffs, incredulous)
We can't go there!
ABIGAIL
Where?
BEN
We need the key to the cipher. I
had copies. He has the originals.
ABIGAIL
Who?
RILEY
He hates you. He'll turn you in.
ABIGAIL
Whoever it is, he sounds like a
good man.
237 EXT. HILLCREST NEIGHBORHOOD - NIGHT 237
Oak trees line the street colonial and Queen Anne homes. *
238 EXT. COLONIAL HOME - NIGHT 238
Ben knocks on the door and waits with Riley and Abigail. A *
beat, then a 60-year-old, graying MAN opens the door. He
takes one look at Ben, then slams the door. Riley shrugs.
BEN
I don't think he recognized me.
RILEY
I think he's still mad at you for
not going to Medical School.
National Treasure, 4/9/03 71.
238 CONTINUED: 238
BEN
(pounds on the door)
Dad! Open the door! I need your
help.
The man opens the door again. We realize now he's PATRICK
GATES, Ben's father. He looks to his son, then to Abigail...
PATRICK
Don't tell me. You got her pregnant.
BEN
No!
Abigail looks down at her stomach, suddenly self conscious.
ABIGAIL
(disappointed)
I look pregnant?
BEN
(to his dad)
I need the Silence Dogood letters.
ABIGAIL
(incredulous)
You have Silence Dogood letters?
BEN
Our great-great-great-greatgrandfather George Washington Gates
found a few hidden in an old desk
he bought at an auction. No one
ever understood their meaning until
we found the pipe.
PATRICK
This better not involve Charlotte.
BEN
My days of looking for Charlotte
are over. I swear. 
RILEY
He's telling the truth, Mr. Gates.
Patrick smiles smug as he opens the door to let them in.
PATRICK
I knew it. I knew there was no
Charlotte. I told you so. 
BEN
Dad, let's not do the "I told you
so" thing.
National Treasure, 4/9/03 72.
238 CONTINUED: (2) 238
PATRICK
I think after all these years I'm
entitled to a little "I told you
so." I told you, I told your
grandpa, I told your mother. You
people wasting your lives chasing
something that doesn't exist--
BEN
--All right, dad, you asked for it. 
Do you really want to know? I.
found. Charlotte. That's right. *
I really found her. *
That stops Patrick. He looks to Abigail.
ABIGAIL
I'm not Charlotte. My name is
Abigail. Dr. Abigail Chase.
BEN
Charlotte was a ship.
PATRICK
I know. She left port from Maine
1779. I wasted seven years searching
the coast of France.
BEN
She never made it to France. I
found the ship's log of the HMS
Erebus, a ship that left port two
days before the Charlotte. The
captain wrote that his ship barely
survived a bad southeaster which I
figured must have blown the Charlotte
off course.
That stops Patrick. His eyes flash with excitement.
PATRICK
How far off course?
239 INT. HOTEL SUITE - NIGHT 239
Ian works on his laptop while Powell and Shaw eat room
service food. His computer BEEPS.
IAN
(triumphantly)
Silence Dogood. Here she is.
ON THE COMPUTER SCREEN are the search results for "Silence"
and "Declaration of Independence." We notice the name
"SILENCE DOGOOD" many times.
SHAW (O.S.)
Who is it?
National Treasure, 4/9/03 73.
239 CONTINUED: 239
We PUSH IN on the screen, then PULL OUT and as we hear Agent
Johnson's voice take over the explanation...
AGENT JOHNSON (O.S.)
Silence Dogood, a.k.a., Benjamin
Franklin.
We PULL BACK and realize that we have transitioned to...
240 EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING, PARKING LOT - NIGHT 240
Sadusky stands with his team at a make-shift command post. 
The FBI has just run the same Google Search. 
Agent Johnson reads from his laptop screen.
AGENT JOHNSON
Ben Franklin was 15 years old,
apprenticing for his brother James'
newspaper when he secretly wrote 14
letters to the Editor of The Courant
using the pen name, Silence Dogood,
a middle-aged widowed wife of a
minister. She wrote about colonial
life, gained quite a following, and
even obtained proposals of marriage.
Sadusky regards the copied letters from Ben's apartment.
SADUSKY
These letters were written by
Benjamin Franklin?
Now, Agent Colfax steps up with a sheet of paper. 
AGENT COLFAX
The gift shop clerk ID'd Gates on
the surveillance tapes from earlier
in the evening.
Sadusky studies Ben's photo.
CLOSE ON THE PICTURE, a grainy surveillance image of Ben in
his tuxedo as he passes through the security checkpoint
upon entering the National Archives gala.
Sadusky hands the photo back to Agent Colfax.
SADUSKY
Release his picture to the press. 
Dr. Chase's too. Someone's bound
to spot them.
241 INT. COLONIAL HOME, DINING ROOM - NIGHT 241
Ben clears the dining room table. Abigail helps, but her
eyes search the room and stop on...A PHONE. But it's too
close to Ben to get to.
National Treasure, 4/9/03 74.
241 CONTINUED: 241
ABIGAIL
Where's the bathroom?
BEN
Down the hall. First door on the
right.
Abigail disappears into the hall.
242 INT. COLONIAL HOME, HALL - NIGHT 242
Abigail moves down the hall and finds to the bathroom. 
Directly across the hall is a study. Abigail glances back
toward the living room, then ducks into the study.
243 INT. COLONIAL HOME, STUDY - NIGHT 243
Packed with books on shelves and in piles. Abigail moves
to a desk and finds a phone cradle...but no phone. She *
notices a collection of FRAMED BUTTONS hanging on the wall. *
CLOSE ON one of the framed buttons. It's a silver-plated
George Washington Inaugural button. There is a note, "Dad,
Found this in a backyard in Maryland. Love, Ben."
BEN (O.S.)
Looking for this?
Abigail turns, startled. She sees the phone in Ben's hand.
BEN (CONT'D)
I thought we had a deal.
ABIGAIL
(covers)
Dr. Herbert will be worried about
me.
BEN
You guys dating?
ABIGAIL
Yes, and he's going to kill you.
BEN
I figured. He looked like your
type.
ABIGAIL
You have no idea what my type is.
BEN
I know you don't like treasure
hunters.
ABIGAIL
I like men I can trust.
National Treasure, 4/9/03 75.
243 CONTINUED: 243
Ben considers that, then hands her the phone and leaves. 
Abigail looks at the phone in her hand, surprised. 
244 INT. COLONIAL HOME, DINING ROOM - NIGHT 244
Abigail emerges from the hallway with the phone to find Ben
standing there.
ABIGAIL
Why did you come after me? You had
the Declaration of Independence. 
You could've just gotten away.
BEN
Why didn't you call your boyfriend?
ABIGAIL
He's not my boyfriend.
They look at each other for a moment, then Riley enters.
RILEY
I parked the van around back. 
Ben hands Abigail the gloves. She dons them, then opens
the tube. They all look at each other for a beat, then...
Abigail carefully slips the Declaration of Independence out
of the tube. The document practically glows with history. 
She catches her breath, mesmerized by its power, then
gingerly unrolls the document. They are all awe-struck. 
Now, Patrick enters with a TRAY OF TEA. He goes to set it
on the table, right on the Declaration of Independence...
...but Ben quickly intercepts the tray.
BEN
Whoa! Not there.
Ben grabs the tray from his dad and sets it on the buffet. 
Now, Patrick notices the ancient parchment on the table.
PATRICK
Where'd you get that? It looks
old.
BEN
A little over 200 years.
PATRICK
Wow. You sure?
Ben and Riley exchange knowing looks. Riley nods...
RILEY
Pretty sure.
National Treasure, 4/9/03 76.
244 CONTINUED: 244
PATRICK
What is it?
RILEY
Just a map.
PATRICK
I don't see anything.
He reaches to turn the parchment over, but Ben stops him.
BEN
This side. It's invisible ink.
PATRICK
So, put it in the oven.
ABIGAIL
No!
PATRICK
Why not? Ferrous sulfate inks can
only be brought out with heat.
ABIGAIL
But it will damage the--
BEN
--parchment. 
(to his dad)
She's right. It's very old. We
can't risk compromising the map.
PATRICK
You need a reagent.
BEN
I know.
Ben grabs a slice of LEMON off the tea tray.
PATRICK
Just the upper right-hand corner.
BEN
(peeved)
I know.
ABIGAIL
If there is indeed a secret message,
it will be marked with a symbol
there first.
BEN
I know.
National Treasure, 4/9/03 77.
244 CONTINUED: (2) 244
He brushes the lemon over the corner of the parchment. 
They all eagerly...wait...for it to reveal...anything.
ABIGAIL
Nothing.
Riley looks hard at the parchment, ready to jump off the
highest building.
RILEY
Nothing?
PATRICK
You sure it's this side?
BEN
It needs heat.
With that, Ben leans in and BREATHES on the parchment. As
if by magic, the puff of warm breath reveals...
A SERIES OF NUMBERS. They appear briefly, flicker, then
disappear. But everyone in the room sees them. A wash of
silence overcomes them, then...
ABIGAIL
We need more heat.
245 CUT TO CLOSE ON a hairdryer blowing on a low setting on the 245
parchment. As it does, a LONG SERIES OF FADED NUMBERS
slowly emerge: 6.14.7, 4.54.4, 10.1.9...
ABIGAIL
Oh. My. God.
PATRICK
A series of numbers. 3 per set. 
BEN
It's an Ottendorf cipher. 
PATRICK
George Washington and the Marquis *
de Lafayette used them to pass secret
messages from the front lines.
RILEY
(covering)
Duh.
BEN
The first number indicates the page
in the key, in this case, the set
of Silence Dogood letters. The
second number in the cipher is the
line on that page. And the third
is the word on that line.
National Treasure, 4/9/03 78.
245 CONTINUED: 245
RILEY
Where is the map with the "X"? *
BEN
There's never a map with an "X."
RILEY
Then, who started that legend?
Abigail studies the numbers, tears welling in her eyes.
ABIGAIL
This is amazing.
BEN
Dad, where're the letters? We need
the letters.
PATRICK
(suddenly guilty)
When you left, I got rid of
everything.
As they talk, Abigail picks up the document and holds it up
to the chandelier light for closer inspection.
BEN
Dad, where are they?!
PATRICK
I donated them.
Riley hangs his head.
RILEY
I hope you got a big tax write-off.
BEN
Who'd you give them to?
PATRICK
There's only one place for them.
BEN
You gave them to the Ben Franklin
Museum?
PATRICK
It completed their collection.
Abigail excitedly scrutinizes the writing on the Declaration
of Independence.
ABIGAIL
This is a tremendous discovery! 
All this time. No one knew there
was something on the back.
National Treasure, 4/9/03 79.
245 CONTINUED: (2) 245
PATRICK
On the back of what?
Patrick peeks at the front of the document, and his face
falls as he now SEES WHAT'S ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE
PARCHMENT. It starts with, "In CONGRESS, July 4th 1776."
PATRICK (CONT'D)
Holy shit! 
BEN
I know.
PATRICK
That's the--
BEN
--I know.
Patrick digests that, about to blow a gasket, then...
PATRICK
(excited)
It's brilliant! Putting the map on
the back of an important document
guaranteed the map's survival.
BEN
I know.
RILEY
Um, guys...
Riley's attention is drawn to the television in the den. 
On the screen is the grainy surveillance picture of Ben
captioned with his name. 
Ben goes to the television and turns it up.
REPORTER (ON SCREEN)
...for questioning in connection
with an attempted robbery at the
National Archives tonight. 
Authorities are also looking for
this woman...
ON THE SCREEN, a picture of Abigail also appears. Abigail
gasps.
REPORTER (ON SCREEN) (CONT'D)
...Dr. Abigail Chase, a museum
employee who has been reported as
missing. Police did not say whether
Dr. Chase is a suspect or a witness,
only that she is the only National
Archives employee not currently
accounted for...
National Treasure, 4/9/03 80.
245 CONTINUED: (3) 245
The thought of her being wanted almost makes Abigail faint.
ABIGAIL
We should turn ourselves in. We
have evidence now.
BEN
The FBI will just think I put those
numbers on the back. They'll put
me in jail, the Declaration back on
display, and Ian will just come
after it again.
PATRICK
He's right. The Declaration of
Independence will never be safe.
RILEY
So, now what?
PATRICK
Find that treasure.
Ben looks to his dad, surprised. It's first time he's seen
a glimmer of approval in his dad's face in a long time.
ABIGAIL
We need to change our clothes.
246 EXT. HILLCREST NEIGHBORHOOD - NIGHT 246
A swarm of POLICE CARS and government sedans sit parked on 
the driveway and street outside Patrick's home.
247 INT. COLONIAL HOME, DINING ROOM - NIGHT 247
Sadusky's team sweeps the house. Patrick sits calmly at
the table as Sadusky scrutinizes the tea service.
PATRICK
My son told me to call you. Said
otherwise I'd be aiding and abetting.
Sadusky looks to Agent Dawes who reads from a dossier.
AGENT DAWES
Benjamin Franklin Gates. Graduated
with honors from Dartmouth with a
PhD in American History. Spent his
summers working on a deep sea salvage
expeditions.
PATRICK
He was looking for Charlotte.
AGENT HENDRICKS
A girl?
National Treasure, 4/9/03 81.
247 CONTINUED: 247
PATRICK
(dramatically)
A quest.
The agents exchange eye-rolling looks, like "another whacko."
SADUSKY
Sir, did your son say where he was
going?
PATRICK *
(thinks) *
No, he never actually said.
SADUSKY
Your son's in a lot of trouble, Mr.
Gates. He's stolen a National
Treasure.
PATRICK
Sometimes a man has to do something
wrong in order to do something right.
SADUSKY
And what would that right thing be?
Patrick reaches for something in his pocket and, IN AN *
INSTANT, every FED (except Sadusky) has their gun out and
trained on Patrick who freezes. Sadusky sighs.
SADUSKY (CONT'D)
Guys. He's going for his wallet.
The agents holster their sidearms, and Patrick pulls out
his wallet, takes out a $1-bill, and lays it on the table.
PATRICK
Have you ever heard of the Lost
Treasure of the Templar Knights? *
248 EXT. COLONIAL HOME - NIGHT 248
Sadusky and his team of agents exit the house. As they
walk, Sadusky studies the one-dollar bill.
AGENT JOHNSON
A map on the back of the Declaration
of Independence? Insanity obviously *
runs in the family.
AGENT COLFAX
Let's hope we recover the Declaration
before he goes into endgame.
SADUSKY
Whether or not there's a treasure map,
Gates isn't the only one after it.
National Treasure, 4/9/03 82.
248 CONTINUED: 248
Agent Dawes looks to her boss, realizing...
AGENT DAWES
The gunfire outside the vault room...
SADUSKY
...Someone was shooting at Gates. 
Someone else who knew about the map.
Sadusky finally pockets the dollar bill.
SADUSKY (CONT'D)
Ben Gates had copies of the Silence
Dogood letters at his apartment. 
He needed them for something. Let's
find out where the originals are.
249 EXT. INDEPENDENCE NATIONAL HISTORIC PARK - DAY 249
REVOLUTIONARY WAR SOLDIERS armed with muskets fire a volley
of shots at a line of RED COATS. BOOM-BOOM-BOOM! Several
British fall. We WIDEN to reveal... 
We're watching a re-enactment of a revolutionary battle. 
Horses, cannons, drums, gunfire. We MOVE through a CROWD
OF TOURISTS which stands on the sidelines and come to...
WASHINGTON SQUARE, where a mock-up of a Continental Army
encampment has been set up for the show. Standing between
the tents, Ben and Abigail survey the scene.
ABIGAIL
He's taking too long. He's been
caught.
BEN
They're not looking for Riley, just
us. He's fine.
250 CUT TO - CLOSE ON a 12-year-old BOY'S FACE pressed against 250
some glass. We WIDEN to see...
251 INT. BENJAMIN FRANKLIN MUSEUM - DAY 251
The BOY is looking through exhibit glass at a collection of
Franklin inventions and artifacts: a glass armonica, a
Franklin stove, and many hand-written LETTERS. 
As the boy studies the letters, we notice some of Sadusky's
team are here, eyeing the crowd.
252 INT. BEN FRANKLIN MUSEUM, OFFICE - DAY 252
The museum CURATOR stands with Sadusky and Agent Dawes. He
studies a photocopy of Ben Gates drivers license picture.
SADUSKY
We're expecting him to come here--
National Treasure, 4/9/03 83.
252 CONTINUED: 252
CURATOR
--I'm afraid you must be mistaken.
The curator hands the photo back to Sadusky.
CURATOR (CONT'D)
The Gates Family donated many of
the Silence Dogood letters to us.
Sadusky and Agent Dawes exchange a curious look.
CURATOR (CONT'D)
Fascinating story how they came to
have them, in fact. Goes all the
way back to President Jackson...
253 INT. BENJAMIN FRANKLIN MUSEUM - DAY 253
The boy finally finishes reading the letters and exits.
254 EXT. 4TH STREET - DAY 254
The boy exits the museum, passing an ACTOR dressed like
BENJAMIN FRANKLIN, spouting aphorisms to PASSERSBY. The
boy crosses the cobblestone street and goes to...
RILEY. Sitting at a bus stop and working on a Gettysburg
Times crossword puzzle. He looks up.
BOY
And.
RILEY
You sure? 4th letter, 22nd line--
BOY
--third word, "and."
RILEY
Good. Thanks.
Riley hands him $5, then jots down "and" under the numbers
"4.22.3."
ON HIS CROSSWORD, we see Riley's written words under the
corresponding codes from the Declaration. So far, it reads:
"The trove unfolds for
He who tolls pass and..."
255 EXT. INDEPENDENCE NATIONAL HISTORIC PARK - DAY 255
Another line of RED COATS falls to cannon fire...BOOM-BOOM! 
The crowd CHEERS, while Abigail grows increasingly anxious.
ABIGAIL
I can't take this anymore.
National Treasure, 4/9/03 84.
255 CONTINUED: 255
Ben watches the re-enactment.
BEN
I know. It's all wrong. We lost
this battle and every other in
Philadelphia...
Abigail regards him. That's not what she meant, but he
continues on his tangent.
BEN (CONT'D)
...Most people don't realize that
George Washington was a rather poor
military tactician, and that it was
really Benedict Arnold who won the
war for us with his victory in the
Battle of Saratoga which finally
earned the Continental Army the
support of France.
Abigail just stares at Ben.
BEN (CONT'D)
What?
ABIGAIL
Nothing. I just thought I was the
only one obsessed with meaningless
historical trivia.
BEN
There's no such thing. Sometimes...
As he talks, Abigail spots something over his shoulder...
IAN and SHAW moving through the crowd toward them.
BEN (CONT'D)
...the littlest things matter the
mos--
Without warning, Abigail grabs Ben and...PULLS him IN FOR A
PASSIONATE KISS. 
Ben's surprised but goes with it until Abigail just as
suddenly pulls out of the kiss.
ABIGAIL
Ian's here.
She motions with her eyes, and Ben follows them to see IAN
and SHAW pushing through the crowd.
BEN
He must've figured out what "Silence"
meant. Which means he's going to
the museum.
National Treasure, 4/9/03 85.
255 CONTINUED: (2) 255
Ben moves to go, but Abigail grabs him.
ABIGAIL
I just want you to know that kiss
meant nothing. I was only doing it
to hide us.
BEN
History remembers what it wants to *
remember.
With that, Ben and Abigail follow Ian and Shaw. *
256 EXT. 4TH STREET - DAY 256*
Crowded with TOURISTS. Ian and Shaw move through the throng. 
They come to the corner. Up ahead is the Ben Franklin
Museum. In front, there are several FEDERAL AGENTS.
Ian stops, looks around, to across the street to where Riley
is waiting. 
Just then, however, a bus pulls up and stops right in front
of Riley, blocking Ian's view.
257 EXT. 4TH STREET - DAY 257
As people climb on and off the bus, Riley stares at something
on the side of the bus. He smiles to himself...
RILEY
I'm a genius.
We REVERSE to see what he was seeing...
CLOSE ON THE WORD "PASS" inscribed in iron. We PULL BACK A
little to see "PASS AND STOW." Then, a little more to see
the words are inscribed on the Liberty Bell in an ad...
...on the side of the bus which now pulls away. A beat,
then Ian steps up with Shaw, but RILEY'S GONE. Ian looks
around. See the trash can. On top, the crossword puzzle.
258 INT. BENJAMIN FRANKLIN MUSEUM - DAY 258
Sadusky and Agent Dawes exit the office. The other agents
all signal him with, "Nothing yet." 
Sadusky notices a WOMAN who looks like a prostitute reading
the Dogood letters.
AGENT DAWES
I don't get it. Why would Gates
want to steal something the family
donated?
But Sadusky isn't listening. He pulls away from his team
to follow the prostitute who is now leaving.
National Treasure, 4/9/03 86.
259 EXT. 4TH STREET - DAY 259
The prostitute crosses the street to the bus stop, but
Riley's long gone. The prostitute looks around.
SADUSKY (O.S.)
Who're you looking for?
The prostitute sees the suit and immediately looks to run,
but she's surrounded by the rest of Sadusky's team.
SADUSKY (CONT'D)
Whoa, you're not in trouble. We're
just looking for the same person
you are.
260 EXT. INDEPENDENCE NATIONAL HISTORIC PARK - DAY 260*
SOLDIERS march to the beat of drums and fife commands. 
Smoke rises over the field from cannon and musket fire. *
Riley moves down a line of Continental Army tents, oblivious *
to the "melee" in the background.
RILEY
I'm a genius. I'm a genius! 
Suddenly, someone grabs him and pulls him BETWEEN THE TENTS. 
Riley almost screams, then sees it's just Ben and Abigail. *
BEN *
Ian's here. *
RILEY
Doesn't matter. I got it. "The
trove unfolds for he who tolls pass
and..." I didn't get the last word,
but I figured it ou--
BEN
--The Liberty Bell.
RILEY
How'd you know?
ABIGAIL *
"Tolls Pass and Stow." It's obvious.
RILEY
Not that obvious.
261 EXT. 4TH STREET - DAY 261
The prostitute sits on the bench, surrounded by FBI.
PROSTITUTE
All I know is the guy didn't want
nothing for his money. Just a word.
National Treasure, 4/9/03 87.
261 CONTINUED: 261
SADUSKY
What word?
262 EXT. INDEPENDENCE NATIONAL HISTORIC PARK - DAY 262
Soldiers march forward, then stop. An actor playing GEORGE
WASHINGTON rides a horse, commanding his troops...
GEORGE WASHINGTON
Fire!
The soldiers fire synchronized volleys. BOOM-BOOM-BOOM! 
The British ranks thin. The crowd goes wild.
263 EXT. 4TH STREET - DAY 263*
Agent Johnson sits in a parked sedan. Sadusky and the others 
wait by the open car door as Agent Johnson works on a laptop.
AGENT JOHNSON
6,903 search hits for the words
"stow" and "Declaration of Independence." The top results being the
Fourth of July and the Liberty Bell.
SADUSKY
The Liberty Bell?
AGENT JOHNSON
Two foundry workers named John Pass
and John Stow cast the bell.
SADUSKY
That's it. Let's go.
264 EXT. INDEPENDENCE NATIONAL HISTORIC PARK - DAY 264
Ian and Shaw move through the park. 
SHAW
You're kidding, right?
IAN
I wish I were.
SHAW
You mean, we have to ring the Liberty
Bell?!
265 INT. LIBERTY BELL PAVILION - DAY 265
Crowded with TOURISTS. A TOUR GUIDE stands next to the
famous bell (which is enclosed in a glass display case). 
TOUR GUIDE
...which hasn't been rung in over
150 years. It was in 1846 on George
(MORE)
National Treasure, 4/9/03 88.
265 CONTINUED: 265
TOUR GUIDE (CONT'D)
Washington's birthday that the final
expansion of the crack occurred,
retiring the Liberty Bell
permanently.
266 EXT. LIBERTY BELL PAVILION - DAY 266
A long line of TOURISTS snakes across the park plaza. 
Sadusky and his team move through the crowded plaza. 
SADUSKY
I want agents posted in the pavilion
and surrounding plaza. As of right
now, the Liberty Bell in under aroundthe-clock guard.
AGENT COLFAX
What exactly do we think Gates is
planning? 
SADUSKY
I don't know, but we already lost
one national treasure, I'll be damned
if we're going to lose another.
267 EXT. INDEPENDENCE HALL - DAY 267
Across the park from the new Liberty Bell Pavilion. 
268 INT. INDEPENDENCE HALL, BELFRY - DAY 268
BOOM-BOOM-BOOM! A trap door in the belfry floor is smashed
open with the butt of the rifle, and Ben, Abigail, and Riley
climb up onto the belfry's platform. 
From here, there is a panoramic view of Independence Park
and Liberty Pavilion.
RILEY
The Liberty Bell is not here. It's
over there.
ABIGAIL
But the bell was here when the map
was written. 
BEN
So, it must be rung from here.
Riley considers that, then...
RILEY
OK, then we simulate it. We get
the bell's exact size and metallurgic
composition and determine the tone
it made--
National Treasure, 4/9/03 89.
268 CONTINUED: 268
ABIGAIL
--E-flat.
RILEY
Perfect. We generate a church bell
e-flat note digital wave file, we
get a couple high excursion, lowdistortion speakers up here, and
plug our ears.
BEN
But what could ringing the bell
possibly do?
RILEY
Maybe some stone will magically
crumble away, finally revealing the
"X" that marks the spot.
Abigail looks to the street below, swarming with POLICE.
ABIGAIL
One thing's for certain, it'll
definitely alert everyone to our
presence.
Ben looks at her, realizing...
BEN
The man who rang the Liberty Bell
when the Declaration of Independence
was signed...who was he?
ABIGAIL
Andrew McNair. There used to be a
plaque commemorating him up here.
BEN
Find it.
They all three immediately get on their hands and knees and
search the old belfry floor. A beat, then...
ABIGAIL
Here it is!
Ben hurries to her. Finds an old bronze plaque under layers
of dirt. Ben rubs away the dirt with his hand. 
CLOSE ON the plaque which is dedicated to:
"Andrew McNair
For tolling the bell on July 8, 1776
Proclaiming the signing of
The Declaration of Independence
--Member Lodge 43, Lancaster Pennsylvania--"
National Treasure, 4/9/03 90.
268 CONTINUED: (2) 268
Ben reads the last line of the plaque.
BEN
"Member Lodge 43"
(looks up)
McNair was a Freemason.
Ben grabs the rifle and pries up the plaque with the bayonet.
ABIGAIL
What are you doing?!
BEN
"The trove unfolds for he who tolls
Pass and Stow." The cipher was
talking about McNair. 
The plaque finally pops off. Underneath...a SMALL HOLE in
the floorboards. Ben looks to them. They both see it.
RILEY
Jesus...
Ben sticks his hand into the hole. A beat, then Ben pulls
out his hand. Turns it over. Opens his fist, revealing...A *
PAIR OF OLD BIFOCALS. *
Riley claps his hands together, happily.
RILEY (CONT'D)
OK! Super! It's been so worth it. 
Can we talk about shares now? 'Cause
I really need a PAIR OF GLASSES!
BEN
Bifocals.
Abigail studies Ben, realizing...
ABIGAIL
Ben Franklin invented them.
RILEY
And I'm sure he's been looking for
this pair! Those Founding Fathers
and their fraternity pranks!
Riley mimics an old man's voice.
RILEY (CONT'D)
"Let's hide old Ben's
bifocals!"
(feigns laughter)
"HA-HA-HA-HA-HA!"
BEN
The map.
ABIGAIL
Here.
Abigail slips the Declaration out of the musket barrel, and
they quickly unroll it as Riley continues his rant.
National Treasure, 4/9/03 91.
268 CONTINUED: (3) 268
RILEY
"And then, because we
have NOTHING BETTER TO
DO, let's put a secret
message on the back of
the Declaration of
Independence!"
BEN
The trove unfolds...
ABIGAIL
...means the treasure can
be seen...
Ben dons the bifocals and looks at the Declaration. 
ABIGAIL (CONT'D)
Well?
Ben takes off the glasses. Hands them to Abigail. She
slips them on as Riley rattles on.
RILEY
"And let's crack the Liberty Bell
too!" "Hey, good idea! And FUNNY!"
Abigail looks at the Declaration. What she sees takes her
breath away. Now, Riley notices the look on her face.
RILEY (CONT'D)
What?
Abigail stares at the Declaration as if in a trance.
RILEY (CONT'D)
What?
Abigail slowly looks to Ben in disbelief. He smiles big. 
Riley looks at them both, impatient...
RILEY (CONT'D)
What? Another riddle? What do we
have to do now? T.P. the White
House?!
Ben takes the glasses off of Abigail's face and hands them
to Riley, who puts them on, and we go to his POV.
CLOSE ON THE BACK OF THE DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE. As
the lenses come into view...
The blank parchment comes alive! A 3-D image magically
appears, rising out of the various shades of parchment
colors, beiges and tans, in a prism, Magic-Eye effect...
An 18th CENTURY CHURCH and CEMETERY. An "X" marks a spot
in the field of graves. The map is dated "August 17, 1776."
RILEY (CONT'D)
(laughs excited)
I knew it! There it is! "X" marks
the spot! That's what I've been
talking about!
National Treasure, 4/9/03 92.
268 CONTINUED: (4) 268
Ben takes the bifocals from Riley. Studies the map again.
BEN
That's Trinity Church.
ABIGAIL
The original Trinity Church burned
down just two months after the
Declaration of Independence was
signed.
BEN
I don't think that was a coincidence. *
269 EXT. LIBERTY BELL PAVILION - DAY 269*
Powell exits the pavilion and rejoins Ian and Shaw in the
plaza. Right behind them is Independence Hall.
POWELL
They're not inside.
IAN
They're here somewhere.
Ian looks around, then realizes. He looks up to...
270 INT. INDEPENDENCE HALL, BELFRY - DAY 270
Abigail rolls up the Declaration and slips it into its cover. 
Just then, we hear someone coming up the steps.
RILEY
Someone's coming.
BEN looks down from the belfry just as IAN looks up from
the plaza below. THEIR EYES CONNECT.
BEN
Ian.
Riley pulls open the trap door and sees POWELL sprinting up
the stairs. Riley slams the trap door shut. 
271 INT. INDEPENDENCE HALL, STAIRWELL - DAY 271
Powell tries to push open the belfry's trap door, but...
272 INT. INDEPENDENCE HALL, BELFRY - DAY 272
Riley's standing on the trap door. He yells to Ben...
RILEY
Go!
Ben and Abigail climb out of the belfry. Riley shoves the *
musket barrel through an iron ring latch on the trap door. *
National Treasure, 4/9/03 93.
273 INT. INDEPENDENCE HALL, STAIRWELL - DAY 273
Powell shoots up at the trap door...BLAM-BLAM-BLAM! 
274 INT. INDEPENDENCE HALL, BELFRY - DAY 274
Riley tap-dances as gunfire chews up the floorboards at his
feet. WOOD SPLINTERS and POPS.
275 EXT. INDEPENDENCE HALL, CLOCK TOWER PARAPET - DAY 275
Ben and Abigail peer over the edge. It's a 20-foot drop to
the roof. Ben looks around for other options. Abigail
hands him the Declaration of Independence.
BEN
What're you doing?
ABIGAIL
I don't want to be responsible for
bending it!
With that, she turns and...JUMPS! She LANDS HARD on the
rock and tarpaper roof below, then looks up to Ben, who's a
little awe-struck by her.
He tosses the Declaration down to her, then jumps too.
276 CLOSE ON the iron latch as BOOM! Gunfire blows it out. 276
277 INT. INDEPENDENCE HALL, BELFRY - DAY 277
Powell bursts up through the trap door into the belfry,
hurries to the edge, and sees Ben and Abigail below.
278 EXT. INDEPENDENCE HALL, ROOF - DAY 278
Ben grabs Abigail and lunges out of the way as the roof is
raked with gunfire. They land hard on a slanted part of
the roof. The force knocks the Declaration of Independence
from Abigail's grip.
Bullets POCK the shingles in their wake, barely missing the
Declaration as it ROLLS...DOWN...THE...INCLINE. 
279 INT. INDEPENDENCE HALL, BELFRY - DAY 279
Powell chases them with gunfire, when suddenly Riley KIPS
DOWN from the outside the belfry's archway and...
KICKS POWELL in the FACE! Powell staggers back, then charges
Riley, slamming him into the wall.
280 EXT. INDEPENDENCE HALL, ROOF - DAY 280
Ben and Abigail slide out of control down the incline. Ben
gets a foothold. Throws out his hand, just catching THE
DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE inches from the edge. 
National Treasure, 4/9/03 94.
280 CONTINUED: 280
But Abigail isn't so lucky. She's out of his reach. She
tumbles OFF THE LEDGE! She SCREAMS!
281 INT. INDEPENDENCE HALL, BELFRY - DAY 281
Powell whip-kicks Riley in the chin. He stumbles backwards. 
Falls through trap door, grabbing the lip with one hand. 
Powell scrambles out of the belfry.
282 EXT. INDEPENDENCE HALL, ROOF - DAY 282
Abigail's fingers grip the rain gutter. A three-story drop
below her. Ben scrambles to the edge and peers over. From
his vantage point, we have a nice, clear view of... 
Abigail's cleavage. It's impossible not to notice. And it
gives Ben pause. The rain gutter CREAKS, ready to give.
ABIGAIL
Um, how about a little help?
Ben looks back to see POWELL jump down from the clock tower.
BEN
No time.
Ben takes the Declaration of Independence...
BEN (CONT'D)
Hold this.
...And SHOVES it down into Abigail's bosom. She's aghast.
ABIGAIL
You can't--
BEN
--Whatever you do, don't bend it.
With that, Ben stands and SLAMS his foot down hard on the
rain gutter which TEARS AWAY FROM THE BUILDING! Rivet by
rivet, POP-POP-POP! 
We FOLLOW ABIGAIL as she falls, jerking sharply each time a
rivet tears away from the plaster. She holds on tight as
the rain gutter swings down like a stiff copper vine... 
283 TO INDEPENDENCE SQUARE. To her surprise, she lands softly. 283
284 EXT. INDEPENDENCE HALL, ROOF - DAY 284
Powell goes to the edge and sees Abigail getting away. He
hurries to a roof access ladder, but BEN TACKLES him from
behind and pins him to the ground. 
Just then, we hear ABIGAIL SCREAM! Ben looks down to see
Ian and Shaw throw ABIGAIL into a Corvette, then peel out.
National Treasure, 4/9/03 95.
284 CONTINUED: 284
Ben takes off sprinting, running the length of the roof in
the direction of the Corvette.
POWELL gets up and takes off running after Ben.
RILEY clambers down from the clock tower and joins the chase.
BEN gets to the end of the roof. There is a gap between
Independence Hall and Congress Hall. A big one. No time
to debate it. Ben LAUNCHES HIMSELF across the gap...
285 EXT. CONGRESS HALL, ROOF - DAY 285
Ben lands hard, shoulder-rolls to his feet.
286 EXT. INDEPENDENCE HALL, ROOF - DAY 286
Powell follows suit. He LEAPS across the chasm...
...But lands short, his body slamming against the bricks,
then falling to the plaza below.
Riley sees him fall, looks away, decides to take the stairs.
287 EXT. CONGRESS HALL, ROOF - DAY 287
Ben sprints across the roof. Looks down to see the CORVETTE
in traffic. A TRUCK a few cars behind. 
Ben FLINGS HIMSELF off the roof...and into a TREE. Lands
on a branch. Which instantly BREAKS. Ben tumbles onto...
288 EXT. TRUCK, MOVING - DAY 288
The roof of the truck. THUNK!
289 INT. CORVETTE, MOVING - DAY 289
Ian drives. Abigail sits stiffly in the front passenger
seat, Shaw's gun to the back of her head.
IAN
Where's the map?
ABIGAIL
It's called the Declaration of
Independence. And it's the reason
we kicked your ass in the war.
Ian sees the plastic sticking up from Abigail's blouse and
reaches for it, but Abigail GRABS HIS WRIST. 
IAN
Ah-ah-ah! Mustn't wrinkle it.
She relents, and Ian slips the document out of her bosom. 
National Treasure, 4/9/03 96.
289 CONTINUED: 289
IAN (CONT'D)
Consider this reparation.
290 EXT. TRUCK, MOVING - DAY 290
Ben crouches like a rodeo rider as the truck pulls alongside
the Corvette. Ben lunges...
291 EXT. CORVETTE, MOVING - DAY 291
Ben lands on top of the Corvette...THUNK!
292 INT. CORVETTE, MOVING - DAY 292
Ian and Shaw hear the clatter overhead. Ian pulls a gun
from under his seat and FIRES up into the car's roof!
293 EXT. CORVETTE, MOVING - DAY 293
Ben rolls aside as the car's roof is ripped up by gunfire.
294 INT. CORVETTE, MOVING - DAY 294
Abigail grabs Ian's arm and struggles with him. Ian can't
drive, shoot Ben, and fight her at the same time.
295 EXT. CORVETTE, MOVING - DAY 295
Ben barely manages to hang on as the car spins sideways
across traffic, then CRASHES into the side of another car. *
296 EXT. LIBERTY BELL PLAZA - DAY 296
Sadusky hears, then sees the mayhem in the adjacent street.
SADUSKY
Get people over there now!
Agent Dawes gets on her radio as they all start sprinting
toward 5th Street.
297 EXT. 5TH STREET - DAY 297
SADUSKY and AGENT DAWES push through panicked TOURISTS, see
the Corvette speeding through traffic with Ben clinging to
the roof. Is it him? Sadusky calls out... *
SADUSKY
GATES! *
Ben turns. Their eyes meet. Sadusky gets a good look;
it's his man. Sadusky pulls out his gun, has a clean shot...
As the Corvette slaloms traffic, Sadusky follows him with
his gun. An easy target. His finger tightens on the
trigger...but...he...just...can't...do...it. 
National Treasure, 4/9/03 97.
297 CONTINUED: 297
The Corvette disappears around a building. Sadusky lowers
his gun, mad at himself.
SADUSKY (CONT'D)
Shit.
298 EXT. INDEPENDENCE NATIONAL HISTORIC PARK - DAY 298
The Corvette SLAMS over the curb, sending screaming PEOPLE
ducking and diving out of the way. The Corvette speeds
toward...
A LINE OF RED COATS. Soldiers scatter, parting like the
Red Sea. HORSES buck and BOLT!
299 INT. CORVETTE, MOVING - DAY 299
Ian navigates through the battle. Suddenly, Ben reaches in
through the open window and grabs the Declaration of
Independence from him.
Ian fights it, but Abigail BITES HIS ARM! Ian smacks her,
then whips the wheel...
300 EXT. INDEPENDENCE NATIONAL HISTORIC PARK - DAY 300
...Sending Ben flying off the top of the Corvette.
We FOLLOW BEN who SLAMS onto the grass. Losing the
Declaration of Independence which...
...ROLLS AWAY down a grassy hill.
Ben gets to his feet, stunned. Realizes he's lost the
document which...
...ROLLS into the path of...
A GROUP OF OFFICERS ON HORSEBACK. 
We FOLLOW the DECLARATION as it rolls through the sea of
hooves...SLAMMING...DOWN...ALL...AROUND...IT!
It finally stops rolling right in front of a BRITISH OFFICER
ON HORSEBACK who tries to calm his panicked horse. 
Ben charges into the stampede.
301 INT. CORVETTE, MOVING - DAY 301
Ian sees the Ben going for the Declaration of Independence,
and he GUNS the Corvette right toward Ben and the horse.
302 EXT. INDEPENDENCE NATIONAL HISTORIC PARK - DAY 302
The Corvette's ENGINE SCREAMS. Ben DIVES one way. The
horse rears back the other way, launching the BRITISH OFFICER
skyward.
National Treasure, 4/9/03 98.
302 CONTINUED: 302
The Corvette skids up between Ben and the Declaration of
Independence. The driver's side door pops open, and Ian
scoops up the Declaration of Independence.
303 INT. CORVETTE - DAY 303
Ian closes his door and turns back to drive but is greeted
by Abigail's elbow, which she SLAMS INTO HIS FACE. 
Ian's nose crunches, spurts blood. Pissed off as all hell,
Ian reels around with his gun...
IAN
You little bitc--
He goes to shoot, but just then, the passenger side door
pops open, and BEN PULLS ABIGAIL OUT THE OTHER SIDE.
304 EXT. INDEPENDENCE NATIONAL HISTORIC PARK - DAY 304
Ben and Abigail roll away from the Corvette in the grass.
305 INT. CORVETTE - DAY 305
Ian goes to shoot them but is stopped by...
SHAW
Forget 'em. Look!
Ian looks through the windshield to see dozens of FEDS
sprinting onto the field of battle. Ian GUNS IT.
306 EXT. INDEPENDENCE NATIONAL HISTORIC PARK - DAY 306
The Corvette peels out. Abigail watches it go.
ABIGAIL
He's got the Declaration!
BEN
I know.
The British Officer staggers to his feet. Goes to his horse,
but the horse is...
...COMMANDEERED by Ben who leaps into his horse's saddle,
whips it around to find his path is blocked by...
SADUSKY AND A LINE OF FEDERAL AGENTS. Guns drawn.
SADUSKY
Freeze, Gates!
Ben looks the Corvette which disappears into traffic.
BEN
You're letting him get away!
National Treasure, 4/9/03 99.
306 CONTINUED: 306
SADUSKY
Get off the horse, and get on your
knees!
The FBI AGENTS move in as we PULL UP above the mayhem to... 
A GOD'S EYE VIEW of the FEDS swarming in on Abigail and Ben
who drops to his knees, defeated as we DISSOLVE TO...
307 CLOSE ON the bifocals which sit on top of an otherwise bare 307
metal table. We WIDEN to reveal we're in...
308 INT. FBI, INTERROGATION ROOM - DAY 308
Ben sits across from Sadusky, Agents Johnson and Dawes, who
finishes the last dregs of her coffee from a styrofoam cup.
AGENT DAWES
They don't look like magic glasses.
BEN
There's nothing magic about it. 
It's an ancient optical effect. 
The Egyptians encoded all their
major art works with it. It's
believed humans used to be able to
see the 3D images with the naked
eye, but the human eye evolved. 
SADUSKY
Evolved? 
BEN
In the Bible, the oceans are
described as being the "color of
wine." That's because the human
eye couldn't see the color blue
back then. Now, it can. Benjamin
Franklin was a genius and inventor. 
He designed these special lenses
and used this optical effect to
hide the map on the back of the
Declaration of Independence.
SADUSKY
You sure you don't want a lawyer?
BEN
Haven't you ever wondered why all
those symbols are on the back of
our one-dollar bill? The All-Seeing
Eye? The pyramid? Our Founding
Fathers were Freemasons, descendants
of the Templar Knights who go all
the way back to Ancient Egypt.
Sadusky and his team all exchange dubious looks, then...
National Treasure, 4/9/03 100.
308 CONTINUED: 308
SADUSKY
Anyone want more coffee?
No takers. Sadusky moves to go, but Ben stops him with... *
BEN
You didn't shoot me. Why?
SADUSKY
What?
BEN
On the car. You had a clear bead
on me. Why didn't you take it?
SADUSKY
Because you don't fire into a crowd.
BEN
Because you knew there was something
else going on here.
Sadusky studies Ben. Says nothing.
BEN (CONT'D)
Let me get the Declaration back. 
Ian Howe can't find the treasure
without the glasses. I'll cut a
deal with him. Tell him I'll give
him the treasure if he gives us the
Declaration of Independence.
SADUSKY
Why don't you just tell us what the
map said, and we'll go make the
trade with Mr. Howe?
BEN
Ian's too smart for that.
Sadusky considers that, nodding his head, then...
AGENT JOHNSON
You wanna know what I believe?
Everyone looks to Agent Johnson.
AGENT JOHNSON (CONT'D)
That you'd do anything to get your
hands on that treasure. That you
and Ian Howe made a deal. But once
you got close to it, you both got
greedy and you each decided you'd
get more of the treasure without
the other. Am I right?
Before Ben can answer, a KNOCK at the door interrupts. 
National Treasure, 4/9/03 101.
308 CONTINUED: (2) 308
Sadusky opens it to find Agents Colfax and Hendricks.
SADUSKY
You find Howe?
Colfax and Hendricks exchange a solemn look, then...
AGENT COLFAX
He just called.
SADUSKY
Great. Where--
AGENT HENDRICKS
--With his ransom demands. He wants
Ben Gates. He's requested that we
release him...
AGENT COLFAX
...And that no police or federal
agents follow him.
SADUSKY
Absolutely not. Out of the question.
AGENT COLFAX
He said that if we don't comply
with his demands by midnight tonight,
he'll...
Agent Colfax's voice trails off. 
SADUSKY
He'll what?
AGENT HENDRICKS
He'll...
(chokes out the words)
...cut off a piece of the Declaration
of Independence every hour and send
it to us in a box.
The agents are all horrified by the prospect.
BEN
He's not bluffing.
Agent Johnson loses it and charges Ben, grabbing him by the
collar and throwing him up against the wall.
AGENT JOHNSON
You little prick. How do we know
that you and Howe didn't plan this
whole thing?! 
BEN
You don't.
National Treasure, 4/9/03 102.
308 CONTINUED: (3) 308
Agent Johnson stares daggers at Ben who looks to Sadusky.
BEN (CONT'D)
But I'm all you got.
309 INT. FBI, BULL PEN - DAY 309
Sadusky escorts a handcuffed Ben toward a glass walled
conference room. Inside, agents huddle around Agent
Hendricks who talks on the phone. 
Hendricks sees Sadusky and pokes his head out of the room.
AGENT HENDRICKS
It's Howe! He wants to talk to
Gates.
310 INT. FBI, CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY 310
Wearing handcuffs, Ben takes the phone from Agent Hendricks.
BEN
(into the phone)
Hello, Ian.
A long beat as Ben listens. A digital recorder records the
conversation in the background while Agent Colfax monitors
it on headphones. Finally....
BEN (CONT'D)
Yes, I understand.
With that, he hangs up and looks to Sadusky.
BEN (CONT'D)
USS Intrepid. Port side. East
River. He's coming in by chopper. 
SADUSKY
New York?
BEN
In three hours.
AGENT DAWES
We'd better hurry.
AGENT JOHNSON
He say anything else?
BEN
No feds. No wires. Or no deal.
311 EXT. UPPER NEW YORK HARBOR - DAY 311
Islands crammed with high rises. 
National Treasure, 4/9/03 103.
312 EXT. USS INTREPID - DAY 312
Retired combat aircraft sit idle on the deck. Flags and
pennants flap in the breeze. 
313 EXT. HARBOR PARKING LOT - DAY 313
A high-tech van sits in the parking lot. Several antennas
protrude from the van's roof.
314 INT. FBI VAN - DAY 314
This surveillance vehicle is packed with equipment. Shirt
off, Ben is wired by Sadusky's team while Sadusky watches. 
Sitting at a computer bay, Agent Colfax wears headphones.
AGENT COLFAX
Say something.
BEN
Can I put my shirt back on?
AGENT COLFAX
All right. He's good.
315 EXT. HARBOR PARKING LOT - DAY 315
Ben climbs out of the van. Turns back.
BEN
I need the bifocals.
Agent Dawes gives them to him, and Ben pockets them.
SADUSKY
As soon as he shows you the
Declaration, we'll move in. Don't
try anything. 
316 EXT. USS INTREPID, BRIDGE - DAY 316
Hidden here is an FBI SNIPER. Through his scope, we FOLLOW
Ben as he climbs the gangway and steps onto the deck.
317 EXT. BUILDING ROOFTOP - DAY 317
Across the street, more FEDS watch and wait. Agent Hendricks
searches the skies with binoculars for the chopper. 
318 EXT. USS INTREPID, DECK - DAY 318
Ben crosses the deck to the port side.
319 EXT. BUILDING ROOFTOP - DAY 319
Finally, Agent Hendricks sees something in the distance. 
National Treasure, 4/9/03 104.
319 CONTINUED: 319
AGENT HENDRICKS
I got a visual.
We see it now. A TINY SPECK in the sky. A chopper?
320 INT. FBI VAN - DAY 320
Sadusky sits with Agents Dawes and Colfax.
AGENT DAWES
Think it's Howe?
Sadusky leans into a microphone.
SADUSKY
Get ready, Gates.
321 EXT. USS INTREPID, DECK - DAY 321
Ben moves to the edge of the deck. Nothing but river below. 
He checks his watch, then...
BEN
(into his mic)
Sadusky?
322 INTERCUT Sadusky in the van. 322
SADUSKY
(into his mic)
Yeah?
BEN (VIA MIC)
I want you to know that Abigail had
nothing to do with this. I know
you believe me.
323 INTERCUT Sadusky and Dawes, exchanging worried looks. 323
AGENT DAWES
What the hell is he talking about?!
SADUSKY
Shit! He set us up!
324 INTERCUT BEN on the deck. He JUMPS! A 60-foot drop... 324
325 SPLASH! Ben knifes into the East River. 325
326 INT. FBI VAN - DAY 326
There's a loud POP! As the wires on Ben's body short out. 
Agent Colfax whips off his headset.
AGENT COLFAX
Sonofabitch!
National Treasure, 4/9/03 105.
327 EXT. HARBOR PARKING LOT - DAY 327
Calling orders into a radio, Sadusky and Dawes jump out of
the van and sprint across the parking lot.
SADUSKY
Gates jumped! He's in the river! 
Move in! Move in!
328 EXT. USS INTREPID, BRIDGE - DAY 328
The FBI SNIPER scrambles, searches the water below, can't
see shit. The flight deck blocks his view.
329 EXT. EAST RIVER - DAY 329
Ben surfaces a few feet from the hull. A beat, then BUBBLES
appear next to him and...
A DIVER'S HEAD pops out of the water. The diver slips back
his mask...it's RILEY.
BEN
Ransom demand?
Riley grins, affects a British accent.
RILEY
I rather liked that part too.
He hands Ben a TANK, REGULATOR, and set of FINS. Grins.
BEN
Just like diving for that wreck off
the coast of France.
Ben jams the regulator into his mouth, and they disappear
from the surface.
330 EXT. USS INTREPID, DECK - DAY 330
FEDS lean over the flight deck, searching the murky water.
331 EXT. HARBOR - DAY 331
More FEDS scour the shore. No sign of Ben.
332 INT. FBI, HOLDING CELLS - DAY 332
Sadusky moves purposefully down a line of holding cells,
stops at one. Inside, sits Abigail. 
SADUSKY
We know you're not involved. You're
free to go.
Abigail looks at him, surprised.
National Treasure, 4/9/03 106.
333 EXT. TRINITY CHURCH - EVENING 333
On the corner of Wall Street and Broadway, this medieval
gothic church is dwarfed by modern skyscrapers all around.
334 INT. TRINITY CHURCH - EVENING 334
We FOLLOW a man's legs, walking up the aisle. He stops a
pew. Sits. We WIDEN to reveal that it's IAN.
BEN (O.S.)
You're late.
We WIDEN MORE to reveal BEN in the pew in front of Ian.
IAN
I took a look around. Waited. 
Made sure you weren't working with
the FBI.
BEN
Satisfied? 
IAN
Not until I get that treasure.
BEN
Do you have the Declaration of
Independence?
IAN
If I give it to you now, how do I
know you won't just walk off with
it and forget about the treasure?
BEN
How do I know you'll give me the
Declaration of Independence after I
show you where the treasure is?
IAN
I guess we're just going to have to
trust each other.
BEN
That's easy for you to say. I never
tried to kill you.
IAN
Come on, Ben. This is a treasure
hunt. It's just the way it is. I
actually quite like you. If we
weren't such enemies, I do believe
we'd be great friends.
BEN
Forget it, Ian. Deal's off.
National Treasure, 4/9/03 107.
334 CONTINUED: 334
Ben stands and starts down the aisle. Ian calls after him... *
IAN
All right!
Ian pulls out his cell phone. Punches in a number. 
IAN (CONT'D)
(into the phone)
Bring it.
BEN
I want the pipe too.
IAN
What pipe?
BEN
The Meerschaum pipe. From the
Charlotte. I found it. You took
it.
Ian rolls his eyes, then talks into the phone...
IAN
And bring the bloody pipe.
With that, Ian hangs up. A beat, then the church doors
open, and SHAW enters with Declaration of Independence in a
mailing tube.
Shaw approaches and hands Ben the tube. He opens it,
verifies that the Declaration of Independence is inside,
then hands it back. 
Ben then reaches into his pocket and pulls out THE BIFOCALS. 
Ian regards them, realizing...
IAN (CONT'D)
The All Seeing Eye.
BEN
(excitedly)
We found them in the Independence
Hall belfry. There really is a map
on the back of the Declaration of
Independence. It's the most
fantastic thing you'll ever see!
Ian is caught up in the moment. He reaches for the bifocals,
but Ben "accidentally" drops them.
We watch as THE BIFOCALS FALL TO THE FLOOR IN SLO-MO and
then land on the tiled floor...CRACK!
And if that isn't bad enough, Ben finishes them off by
STOMPING ON THEM WITH HIS SHOE...CRUNCH! 
National Treasure, 4/9/03 108.
334 CONTINUED: (2) 334
The bifocals lie on the floor in a million crystal pieces.
BEN (CONT'D)
Whoops! I guess you'll just have
to take my word for it.
Enraged, Ian lunges at Ben and tackles him to the church
floor. PARISHIONERS crane their necks to see the commotion. 
Ian pins Ben and shoves a gun into Ben's stomach.
IAN
I'll kill you for that!
BEN
You do, and the secret to the
treasure dies with me.
Ian stares at Ben. Knows he's not bluffing.
BEN (CONT'D)
I give you the treasure; you give
me the Declaration of Independence.
IAN
That's it?
BEN
That's it.
Ian stands, then holds out his hand for Ben. 
IAN
I guess that makes us partners again.
Ben ignores him. Gets to his feet.
BEN
Oh yeah. And no guns.
335 INT. TRINITY CHURCH, FOYER - NIGHT 335
The REVEREND enters the foyer just as Ben, Ian, and Shaw
exit. The Reverend moves to the collection dish and finds... 
...Two GUNS. He looks around, where did these come from?
336 EXT. TRINITY CHURCH - NIGHT 336
Ben, Ian, and Shaw exit the church, passing AN OLD LADY IN
A BLACK SHAWL who reaches out and GRABS BEN'S WRIST! 
Startled, Ben looks to the woman, realizes it's...ABIGAIL. 
She pushes back her shroud.
BEN
What're you doing here?!
National Treasure, 4/9/03 109.
336 CONTINUED: 336
ABIGAIL
I saw the map, remember? *
Ben and Ian exchange a knowing look.
IAN
Bloody hell!
ABIGAIL *
Don't worry. Nobody followed me. *
337 INT. PLAZA HOTEL LOUNGE - NIGHT 337
Sadusky, Agent Dawes, and Agent Johnson enter. Agents
Hendricks and Colfax stand outside the ladies restroom, *
tails between their legs. 
AGENT COLFAX
She asked to go to the bathroom. *
AGENT HENDRICKS
She was only in there for 30 seconds. *
I swear.
Sadusky looks around, moving forward.
SADUSKY
All right. Both Gates and Dr. Chase
came here, to Manhattan. What for? 
AGENT JOHNSON
The treasure.
AGENT HENDRICKS
There's no way any treasure's still
buried here. Everything's changed,
ground's been dug up for subways
and underground parking lots, high
rises.
SADUSKY
So what in Manhattan hasn't changed
in over 200 years?
338 EXT. TRINITY CHURCH GRAVEYARD - NIGHT 338
Worn tombstones and crypts going all the way back to the
17th century are enclosed in this ancient churchyard by an
old wrought iron fence.
Ben, Abigail, Ian, and Shaw come around the corner.
IAN
Normally I find graveyards rather
depressing, but in this case, I
find it uplifting and full of
promise. Where do we start?
National Treasure, 4/9/03 110.
338 CONTINUED: 338
Riley approaches, carrying a shovel.
RILEY
Uh, bad news. There's no "X."
BEN
Yes, there is.
RILEY
I've looked all over.
BEN
You're not looking right.
IAN
Problem, partner?
BEN
No.
Ben and Abigail look around. Then, Ben looks to the sky.
BEN (CONT'D)
In the map, there was a crescent *
moon in the sky. *
ABIGAIL *
Maybe the "X" can only be seen at *
night.
Realizing, Ben starts walking back toward the church. Riley *
calls after him.
RILEY
Well, it's night now, and I don't
see it!
With that, Ben pulls open the heavy church doors, and...
LIGHT SPILLS OUT OF THE CHAPEL, cutting a swath through the
graveyard, casting EERIE TOMBSTONE SHADOWS everywhere.
None of which look like an "X." Except maybe...
Ben moves to where the shadow of a plant is cast onto the
wall of A LONG STONE CRYPT.
Ben backtracks, following the source of the shadow to...
A GRAVESTONE. Covered in ivy. As Ben starts pulling away
the ivy, Ian and the others approach.
Ben clears the ivy, revealing the gravestone. We see now
that a TEMPLAR CROSS has been hewn out of the ancient stone.
They all exchange knowing looks.
National Treasure, 4/9/03 111.
338 CONTINUED: (2) 338
RILEY (CONT'D)
"X" marks the spot.
IAN
Here? Under this grave?
Ian grabs Riley's shovel, goes to start digging, but Ben
stops him with...
BEN
No.
Ben points across the cemetery.
BEN (CONT'D)
There.
They all follow his finger and finally see it. The "X" in
the gravestone casts a giant shadow of an "X" on the side
of the stone crypt. Ben smiles.
BEN (CONT'D)
"X" marks the spot.
He moves to the crypt. The shadow falls in the direct
center. Riley laughs excitedly.
RILEY
Can you believe that?
IAN
I will when I see the treasure.
Ben kneels beside the worn crypt. Feels carefully along
the surface as if reading Braille. He stops. Digs out
some soft dirt, revealing what looks to be... 
A SMALL KEYHOLE.
BEN
Ian, give me the pipe.
Shaw digs the pipe out of his pocket and hands it to Ben. *
Abigail eyes the pipe. *
ABIGAIL
My God, that's an amazing piece! 
What craftsmanship!
BEN
I know. That's why I hate this part.
ABIGAIL
What part?
Ben SLAMS the pipe against the stone. It SHATTERS, revealing
a THIN SKELETON KEY that was hidden inside. 
National Treasure, 4/9/03 112.
338 CONTINUED: (3) 338
Ben scoops up the key and slips it into the key hole. A
perfect fit. He looks to the others who all stand by
anxiously, then TURNS THE KEY.
Suddenly, there is a loud SCRAPING SOUND as a two-foot thick
section of the crypt's lid SLIDES OPEN on a ancient pulley
system. As it opens we can see...
A NARROW PASSAGE. Barely wide enough for one person to
squeeze through. A very dark.
They all exchange a look. And can't help but smile at their
sudden success. Ian looks to Riley.
IAN
You first.
RILEY
No way. The guy who goes first
always gets killed. 
ABIGAIL
That's silly.
RILEY
Hey, I don't make the rules. There's
always a map with an "X," and there's
always a trap. Maps and traps. 
That's just what guys who hide
treasures do.
BEN
I'll go first.
Ben flicks on a flashlight and ducks down inside. 
339 INT. UNDERGROUND STAIRWAY - NIGHT 339
Old moss covered steps descend at a steep angle into
darkness. Ben waves his flashlight around. The passageway
below takes a sharp turn. He calls up to the others.
BEN
Looks OK!
340 EXT. TRINITY CHURCH GRAVEYARD - NIGHT 340
Riley steps down next, but just then, the lid begins to
RUMBLE CLOSED! Ian pushes Abigail harshly aside.
341 INT. UNDERGROUND STAIRWAY - NIGHT 341
Ben hears the rumbling, looks back, sees Ian and Shaw coming
down the stairs, pushing by Riley.
BEN
Where's Abigail?!
National Treasure, 4/9/03 113.
341 CONTINUED: 341
Ben pushes by them and charges back to the stairs to see
that the crypt entrance is CLOSING...CLOSING... 
342 EXT. TRINITY CHURCH GRAVEYARD - NIGHT 342
Abigail looks to the crypt. It's almost closed. She
scrambles to her feet, lunges for the crypt, and...
TUMBLES through the door...
343 INT. UNDERGROUND STAIRWAY - NIGHT 343
...and ROLLS RIGHT INTO Ben's arms just as the crypt door
seals behind her, inches from crushing her. Ben holds her,
their faces almost touching. The chemistry...electric.
ABIGAIL
How'd I know if I hung out with you
long enough, I'd eventually be
robbing graves?
Ben grins, cocky. Just then, Riley pokes his head into the *
stairwell, carrying a lantern. *
RILEY
You guys coming down the creepy
stairway or what?
344 INT. UNDERGROUND CATACOMBS, PASSAGEWAY - NIGHT 344
Ben, Abigail, and Riley join Ian and Shaw, and they move
down this long, stone-walled tunnel. 
IAN
I know you all think I'm the "bad
guy," but were it not for me making
the hard choices, we wouldn't be
here now, would we?
BEN
If you don't want to be the "bad
guy," Ian, all you have to do is
give me the Declaration of
Independence.
IAN
Even if I gave it to you, you
wouldn't leave. You're too close.
BEN
Try me.
Ian studies Ben for a beat, then...
IAN
Sorry. I need you to find the
treasure. 
National Treasure, 4/9/03 114.
344 CONTINUED: 344
Abigail holds her lantern up to the walls which are
intermittently coffered with lions' heads, solar-crosses,
and snakes. She looks to Ben who explains...
BEN
Masonic symbols.
ABIGAIL
What do they mean?
BEN
That we're getting close.
RILEY
But watch out for the trap. Because
it's coming up.
345 INT. UNDERGROUND CATACOMBS, OSSUARY - NIGHT 345
Ben, Abigail, Riley, Ian, and Shaw enter this dark, dank,
dirt-walled room. They shine the lights about, but there's
nothing here. 
IAN
Dead end.
Suddenly, a SKELETON'S TORSO falls out of the ceiling, right
in front of Riley's face. He SCREAMS!
Ben shines his flashlight upwards to see...
HUNDREDS OF GRINNING SKULLS, half buried in the dirt ceiling,
peering down at them. The remnants of uniforms, boots, and
brass buttons can be seen.
ABIGAIL
Hessians.
(off Riley's look) *
German soldiers who fought for the *
British during the Revolution. 
They were buried in a common grave.
Shaw looks up. Just above him, there is a gun and flintlock
powder horn in a dead soldier's belt.
IAN
There must be another outlet. 
Something we missed. Come on.
They all turn to go, but Shaw hangs back. He reaches up to
the gun and tries to take it, but it's stuck. 
As Shaw yanks harder, bits of dirt and dust rain down on
him. Suddenly...
A BAYONETED RIFLE SWINGS out of the ceiling like a pendulum
attached to a skeleton's arm, and...
National Treasure, 4/9/03 115.
345 CONTINUED: 345
...STABS SHAW in the chest! 
The group turns and sees Shaw as he staggers back with the
rifle stuck in his chest. Ben goes to help him, but Shaw
crashes into... 
The dirt wall behind him which caves in under his weight. 
Shaw falls through the hole in the wall, screaming all the
way down. Which sounds like a long way down.
The group rushes to the hole in the wall and shine their
lights into it, revealing...
A DEEP, NARROW SHAFT in the wall. In the shaft, there hangs
two heavy chains with weights attached.
IAN (CONT'D)
Well, that was fortunate, now wasn't
it?
Ben reaches into the shaft and adjusts the weights on the
chains. The chains CREAK as an ancient WOODEN BOX descends
into view from higher in the shaft.
Ben and Abigail exchange a look.
ABIGAIL
It looks like an elevator.
Ben and Riley pry open the door on the box, and a MILLION
RATS and COCKROACHES pour out from the elevator cab! They
all gulp, staring at the vermin. A beat, then...
RILEY
I hate elevators.
Ben steps inside. The elevator CREAKS and GROANS but holds.
BEN
Come on.
They all step in. MORE CREAKING. Ben adjusts the weights *
again and the cab descends. *
346 EXT./INT. TRINITY CHURCH, VARIOUS - NIGHT 346
Sadusky's team sweep the church and surrounding grounds.
347 EXT. TRINITY CHURCH GRAVEYARD - NIGHT 347
Sadusky is here, kneeling in the dirt next to the crypt. *
He picks up a piece of the broken Meerschaum pipe and *
examines them. Agent Dawes approaches.
AGENT DAWES
Got a positive ID from the Reverend. 
They were here.
National Treasure, 4/9/03 116.
347 CONTINUED: 347
But Sadusky isn't listening. He looks to the crypt and
notices that the edges of the stone have recently been
disturbed. The ivy overgrowth has also been torn away.
AGENT DAWES (CONT'D)
What is it?
Sadusky tries to lift the crypt's stone lid to no avail.
AGENT DAWES (CONT'D)
There's no moving that. It's got *
to weigh a ton.
Sadusky looks at Agent Dawes and realizes she's right.
SADUSKY
I want sonar here on the double. 
And bring in a jackhammer!
348 INT. UNDERGROUND ELEVATOR CAGE - NIGHT 348
All eyes look around, warily as the cab descends creakily
into depths unknown. Deeper...deeper still...
RILEY *
I just want to point our that there
are no buttons on the panel. In
fact, there is no panel. How's this
thing going to take us back up?
BEN
It's a one-way elevator.
RILEY
Then, it's not an elevator, is it? *
Because it doesn't elevate.
Suddenly, the cab STOPS. They've hit something. WATER
rushes in at their feet, filling the cab up to their ankles.
Riley and Ian pull open the wooden elevator door, and more
water RUSHES IN...
349 INT. UNDERGROUND CATACOMBS, ANTECHAMBER - NIGHT 349
They shine their lights into the room. The chamber is
circular, and there is a STONE PLATFORM in the center. 
Three 14th Century SWORDS jut out of the stone platform in
a crisscross formation.
BEN
Templar Swords.
Ian moves to the platform, followed by Ben and Abigail. *
Riley slogs out last. He steps something which CRUNCHES
under his foot. Riley looks down to find...
National Treasure, 4/9/03 117.
349 CONTINUED: 349
...a SKELETON.
RILEY
I knew it. 
(sing-song)
It's a trap.
Riley starts searching the walls for a way out while Ian,
Ben, and Abigail study the swords.
ABIGAIL
What do they mean?
Ian reaches for one of the swords.
BEN
Ian, I wouldn't--
But Ian does anyway. He pulls out the center sword. We
immediately hear the RUSHING SOUND OF WATER. Everyone looks
around. The sound is all around them. 
RILEY
What's that?
But Ian doesn't care. He just studies the sword. Riley
continues feeling the walls but can find no exit.
RILEY (CONT'D)
How're we supposed to get out of
here?
BEN
Look at this.
Ben shines his light on the side of the platform to see a
bas relief a SNAKE CUT INTO PIECES carved into the stone.
Abigail immediately recognizes the severed snake symbol.
ABIGAIL
"Join or die."
RILEY
I say we join.
Ben kneels down to study a STONE SLOT in a CIRCULAR STONE
at a vertex of a triangle etched into the floor.
BEN
When we were at war with France,
Ben Franklin drew a political cartoon
of a snake cut into eight pieces,
representing the eight colonies at
the time. The cartoon called the
colonies to "Join or Die."
National Treasure, 4/9/03 118.
349 CONTINUED: (2) 349
The sound of the rushing water intensifies as Ben notices
two more slots in the floor at the triangle's other vertices.
RILEY
But what does that mean?
Now, the sound of the RUSHING WATER builds to a CRESCENDO,
and suddenly, WATER VOMITS into the chamber from several
ancient drains in the walls near the ceiling.
The force of the thundering cascade knocks all of them off
their feet, Ian drops his sword, but more importantly...
...HE DROPS THE DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE INTO THE WATER!
Water also pours into the chamber from the elevator shaft. 
Before anyone can react, the chamber is already filled up
to their chests.
Abigail and Ben both see the Declaration of Independence in
its tube bobbing around in the churning water. 
Ben frantically swims to it, but it slips away...just out
of his reach.
ABIGAIL
I got it!
The tube floats to Abigail. She scoops it out of the water,
then holds it over her head as the water swirls around her.
The chamber is filling quickly, and it's now mostly dark,
except for the faint glow of the submerged flashlights. 
Everyone claws at the walls, finding no purchase in the
smooth stone. Ben calls over the din of the rushing water.
BEN
Listen! We have to work together! 
"Join or die."
RILEY
How?!
BEN
There is a triangle carved into the
floor! At each vertex, there is a
slot! We must get the swords, then
each of us must stick them in the
slots and turn the swords! All of
us, together!
Riley regards Ben for a long beat, then...
RILEY
Are you out of your mind?!
Ben answers by disappearing under the water's surface.
National Treasure, 4/9/03 119.
349 CONTINUED: (3) 349
Riley and Abigail exchange a look. Then, Riley looks up. 
The flat stone ceiling is only a few feet overhead now. 
They'll soon be drowned. Riley takes a deep breath, then
dives down.
350 UNDERWATER. Ben dives down to the platform. The two 350
remaining SWORDS are still sticking up out of it. He grabs
one. Riley swims up behind him and grabs the other. They
both then kick back toward the surface.
351 IN THE CHAMBER. Ben and Riley resurface with the swords, 351
gasping for breath. Ben hands Ian the sword. *
BEN *
Find the slot! At the triangle's *
vertex. 
The stone walls suddenly GROAN under the tons of pressure.
BEN (CONT'D)
Go!
All three disappear underwater, leaving Abigail, holding *
the Declaration up high, but the water is rising rapidly. *
352 EXT. TRINITY CHURCH GRAVEYARD - NIGHT 352
WORKERS finally jackhammer through the crypt wall, and
Sadusky peers inside.
353 INT. UNDERGROUND CATACOMBS, ANTECHAMBER - NIGHT 353
Abigail still holds the Declaration of Independence above
her head, but there is less than a foot of space left now.
354 UNDERWATER. Riley and Ian dive down, feel the floor, find 354
edges of the triangle, and follow them. BEN also feels the
floor, searching for the sword...
355 IN THE CHAMBER. Only inches of space left now. Abigail 355
presses the Declaration of Independence and her face
against the ceiling in the cramped pocket of air.
356 UNDERWATER. Ian follows his edge. Finds the vertex slot. 356
Shoves his sword into it. Turns it. 
RILEY finds his vertex and does the same. 
BEN finally finds the sword.
357 IN THE CHAMBER. Abigail and the Declaration of 357
Independence are now completely submerged. There is no air
pocket anymore. 
358 UNDERWATER. Ben finds the third vertex, plunges the sword 358
into the slot and...
...TURNS IT.
National Treasure, 4/9/03 120.
359 ON ABIGAIL. Suddenly, the chamber ceiling RUMBLES as the 359
heavy stone ceiling slabs START SLIDING APART!
360 CUT TO - PITCH BACK. We hear the SCRAPING SOUND of the 360
stone floor rolling open. As it does, the faintest glimmer
of light peeks up from the submerged flashlights below. 
A beat, then Abigail's hand POKES UP THROUGH THE CRACK in
the floor, holding the Declaration of Independence. 
She tosses it aside onto the dry floor, then pulls herself
up through the opening.
Ian pulls himself up through the floor next, then rolls
aside, gasping for air in a soggy heap.
361 INT. UNDERGROUND CATACOMBS, OSSUARY - NIGHT 361
Sadusky and his team sprint down the passageway and come to
the grave room. Only now, the elevator shaft is COMPLETELY
FLOODED. 
The elevator chains disappear into a pool of water which
spills into the ossuary.
SADUSKY
There's got to be another way down. 
Find it!
362 INT. UNDERGROUND TREASURE CHAMBER - NIGHT 362
The water gurgles up through the widening crack in the floor. 
Abigail waits by it. A beat, then Riley surfaces, coughing. 
ABIGAIL
Where's Ben?
Ian catches his breath, then peers into the darkness. In
the near distance, we can see something...GLIMMERING.
Suddenly, the floor starts rumbling closed again. Panicked,
Abigail calls out...
ABIGAIL (CONT'D)
Ben! Ben!
Ian picks up the Declaration of Independence which lies on
the stone floor near him.
Just then, Ben comes up, gasping for air, choking on
swallowed water, but...holding a flashlight.
BEN
(between coughs)
I thought we might need this.
The flashlight beam cuts through the darkness. We catch
glimpses of pillars, statues, stone steps... 
National Treasure, 4/9/03 121.
362 CONTINUED: 362
RILEY
Is that...?
The beam of light stops on something very shiny... It's a
three-tiered bronze-gilded altar. The very sight of it
makes Abigail gasp. Ian stares at it, mesmerized...
IAN
"...An altar of bronze, twenty cubits
long and twenty cubits wide..."
Second Book of Chronicles.
Ian and Ben exchange knowing looks.
BEN
Stolen from the Temple of Solomon
in the 5th Century B.C.
The group moves to the altar where they find candles and
torches. They quickly light them, then turn to see...
THE TREASURE CHAMBER. 
Dozens of marble Doric and Corinthian columns line the walls
of the cavernous chamber filled with ancient treasures...
Crown jewels, gold and silver plates and chalices, gilded
cherubim, olivewood furniture, carriages, loot from the
Oracle of Delphi, and countless sacred artifacts.
ABIGAIL
This is what it must have been like
to find King Tut's Tomb.
RILEY
Don't say that. Those guys were
cursed.
Ian starts moving through the chamber, in awe of its
treasures. But Ben doesn't move. He just stands there.
BEN
We'll be taking the Declaration of
Independence now, Ian. 
Ian finds a chest, opens it...it's filled with ancient Greek
and Roman coins.
IAN
Oh come on, Ben. Have some fun.
Ian moves past the chest, and Riley can't help himself. He
goes to it, sticks his hand in it, and comes up with a
handful of coins. He laughs, incredulous.
BEN
A deal's a deal, Ian.
National Treasure, 4/9/03 122.
362 CONTINUED: (2) 362
But Ian isn't listening. He's found another ANCIENT SWORD,
only this one is different...special. 
Its silver handle is decorated with images of scythed
chariots engaged in battle and the famous Macedonian King.
Riley steps up behind Ian. He sees the sword. 
RILEY
Cool gothic sword. 
IAN
It's not just any sword...
Ian picks it up. It's heavy. Weighs more than 30 pounds.
IAN (CONT'D)
...It's the sword of Alexander the
Great...
As Ian holds up the sword, we notice that it almost GLISTENS
with an ethereal power.
IAN (CONT'D)
...It was used to conquer the world.
Without warning, Ian swings the sword backwards under his
arm in a rowing motion and... 
...Plunges it into RILEY'S STOMACH! 
Riley staggers back, stunned. Then, he collapses.
Shocked and horrified, Ben and Abigail rush to Riley. He's
bleeding. Badly.
BEN
Riley. Oh, Jesus...
Ben takes off his shirt. Balls it up. Presses it on Riley's
wound. Abigail helps Ben hold it there. Riley looks up to
Ben. He knows it's bad. He grimaces in agony. *
RILEY
At least I was rich before I died. *
With that, Ian swings his sword at Ben who just barely rolls
out of the way it time. The sword hits the stone floor
with a loud CLANK, taking out divot of stone.
IAN
You couldn't just want the treasure
now, could you, Ben?
Ian swings again, but Ben grabs a bronze plate and blocks
the blow. SPARKS fly as the plate shatters.
National Treasure, 4/9/03 123.
362 CONTINUED: (3) 362
IAN (CONT'D)
You couldn't just be reasonable and
argue with me over shares. I say,
"How about 70-30?" And then you
say, "How about 60-40?" And then I
say, "What about 80-20?"
Ben scrambles to his feet, and Ian chases him.
IAN (CONT'D)
No, you have to go and be all noble.
He swings the sword at Ben again, but Ben dives behind a
suit of armor which Ian SMASHES with his sword.
Ben goes down with the medieval suit which clatters to the
ground. Ben shoulder-rolls to his feet and comes up with a
sword of his own. 
They face off. En Guard! They circle each other.
IAN (CONT'D)
I don't trust honest men.
Ian strikes. Ben parries. Their swords cross with a loud
CLANK. They push off each other, and then the duel begins
in earnest. *
Actually, it's more like two guys fighting a bar fight with *
heavy swords. Neither is trained in fencing, but neither *
is about to give up first. *
They exchange blows in an exhausting Rob Roy-esque sword
fight. Ian attacks. Ben parries and simultaneously delivers *
a brutal kick to Ian's ribs, staggering Ian. 
The Declaration of Independence falls to the ground and
rolls away, down some stone steps...
Angered, Ian winds up. Strikes a vicious blow. Ben deflects
it with his sword which breaks in half. The other half
clanks to the ground.
ON ABIGAIL. She's applying pressure to Riley's wound. She
sees the Declaration of Independence rolling toward a slatted
drain in the floor...
She grabs Riley's hands and puts them on the now bloody,
balled up shirt.
ABIGAIL
Apply pressure.
Riley weakly holds onto the field dressing as...
Abigail hurries to the still rolling Declaration of
Independence which is almost to the drain.
National Treasure, 4/9/03 124.
362 CONTINUED: (4) 362
Abigail DIVES FOR IT...but just misses it. The Declaration
of Independence slips through the slats and DISAPPEARS DOWN
THE DRAIN!!!
ON IAN and BEN. Ian swings. Ben ducks and dodges, but
Ian's sword catches pieces of him. Slices into Ben's
shoulder. And his chest.
ON ABIGAIL. She sticks her hand into the drain...
INSIDE THE DRAIN. The Declaration of Independence is stuck
way down deep in the drain where the drain narrows. 
Abigail's hand reaches down for the tube, but it's...just...
out...of...reach.
ON BEN and IAN. Bloodied, Ben hurls the broken sword at
Ian who deflects it and charges Ben.
Ben scrambles over the treasure pile, improvising, grabbing
whatever he can to parry Ian's blows. A chalice...CLANK! 
An urn...which shatters!
Ben grabs an alabaster cherubim. He holds it up to deflect
a blow, but notices that it's just too beautiful to ruin. 
Ben sets it back down, then dives behind a PILLAR just as...
Ian swings again, striking the pillar instead...WHAM! Chunks
of marble fly.
Ian circles around the pillar, chasing the wounded Ben with
his sword. Ian swings, and Ben ducks. This time, Ian's
sword gets STUCK in the pillar.
As Ian tries to extricate it...
Ben pushes a Greek limestone statue. But it's heavy. It
teeters...finally tips.
Ian turns just in time to see the statue about to crush
him. CRASH!
But it doesn't crush Ian. The statue instead crashes into
the pillar, leaving just enough space to save Ian. 
Ian grabs the sword, yanks it out... 
Bad idea. The pillar gives way, and the statue finishes
its fall, smashing down on Ian. Killing him instantly.
And tearing a hole in the stone wall behind him. Water
GUSHES IN from the hole. It's the elevator shaft.
As the water rushes in, the whole treasure chamber begins
to rumble. Pieces of the stone ceiling start to fall,
crashing down all around.
Ben looks to see Abigail still struggling with the drain.
National Treasure, 4/9/03 125.
362 CONTINUED: (5) 362
ON ABIGAIL. She's got her whole arm in the drain but she
still can't reach the Declaration of Independence. Rocks
and debris rains down all around her.
BEN (O.S.)
Look out!
Abigail pulls her hand out of the drain. Turns to see Ben
holding the Sword of Alexander up high. He swings it down,
SMASHING the drain open. 
Abigail quickly reaches in and pulls out the Declaration of
Independence.
They hurry to Riley. Everything is shaking, falling apart.
RILEY
(weakly)
The treasure room's caving in.
BEN
We know.
RILEY
That always happens.
Ben and Abigail grab Riley under his arms and help him to
the pillar that's crashed through the wall. The water has
leveled off in the shaft.
363 INT. UNDERGROUND CATACOMBS, SHAFT - NIGHT 363
Ben and Abigail peer into the shaft. The two chains
disappear into the water below.
BEN
We have to get in the water.
ABIGAIL
(to Riley)
Can you swim?
RILEY
Do I have a choice?
As everything in the treasure chamber collapses behind them,
Ben pushes Riley into the water and jumps in after him. *
Abigail follows, then Ben swings the sword and cuts one of *
the chains. The elevator shoots out of the depths, catching
Ben, Abigail and Riley and carrying them up the shaft!
364 INT. UNDERGROUND CATACOMBS, OSSUARY - NIGHT 364*
The three roll off the roof of the charging elevator and
spill out onto the ossuary floor as the elevator disappears
up into the shaft with the sword. *
National Treasure, 4/9/03 126.
364 CONTINUED: 364
Abigail lands on Ben. They regard each other. Surprised
to be alive. Dust and debris settle in the room. *
Riley lies in the dirt, staring up at the hundreds of *
grinning skulls looking down on him.
RILEY
Are we dead?
365 EXT. TRINITY CHURCH GRAVEYARD - NIGHT 365
Sadusky, his team, and dozens of POLICE are here.
BEN (O.S.)
Hey, can we get a little help over
here?
Sadusky turns to see Ben and Abigail helping Riley out of
the crypt stairwell. In an instant, a swarm of federal
agents and police are on them.
366 EXT. TRINITY CHURCH, BROADWAY - NIGHT 366
Sadusky hands the Declaration of Independence over to an
armored transport, which pulls away with an escort of a
dozen police cars. 
Sadusky's team, Ben, and Abigail stand nearby with two EMTs *
who load Riley onto an ambulance. *
EMT *
(to Ben) *
He lost a lot of blood, but he's *
going to be fine.
Now, Sadusky approaches.
SADUSKY
OK, guys let's go.
The federal agents all start to leave. Ben and Abigail
look at each other, confused.
BEN
Aren't you going to arrest us? *
SADUSKY
What for? You do something wrong?
Ben and Abigail exchange a look like, no...okay...go...bye! *
Sadusky grins at them, then heads to his sedan. *
SADUSKY (CONT'D)
You kids need a ride?
Ben and Abigail smile at each other.
*
National Treasure, 4/9/03 127.
366 CONTINUED: 366
BEN *
No thanks. We'll walk. *
SADUSKY
All right. Good night!
CLOSE ON Sadusky's hand as he climbs into his car. On his
finger, we now see that he wears a SILVER MASONIC RING,
just like the one Charles Carroll and Count Pulaski wore.
As Sadusky drives away, Ben and Abigail look back to the *
Trinity Church graveyard. *
BEN *
Too bad no one will ever know. *
ABIGAIL *
We'll know. *
With that, she kisses Ben. A long, deep kiss. Then, *
suddenly, Ben pulls away.
BEN *
Just tell me one thing. Does this *
kiss mean anything?
Abigail considers that, then... *
ABIGAIL *
Only time will tell. *
With that, they kiss some more as we PULL BACK as the federal *
agents all get in their cars and leave...
DISSOLVE TO:
367 INT. NATIONAL ARCHIVES, ROTUNDA - MORNING 367*
Ben, Abigail, Riley (all better now), Ben's dad Patrick,
Sadusky, his whole team, Dr. Herbert, Woodruff, and all the
National Archives GUARDS stand proud, watching as...
THE DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE is raised back up in its
display case to its wall exhibit.
Dr. Herbert crosses himself. Thank God. Woodruff sheds a
tear. Ben, Abigail, and Riley exchange cocky smiles. Dr.
Herbert checks his watch.
DR. HERBERT
Opening time.
And with that, the "ceremony" is over. Everybody scatters,
back to their regular routine. Woodruff takes one more
look at the precious document, then shrugs...
WOODRUFF
No one will ever know.
National Treasure, 4/9/03 128.
368 EXT. NATIONAL ARCHIVES, NORTH FOYER - MORNING 368
The GUARDS open the front doors, and museum PATRONS and 
TOURISTS start filing in. Ben and Riley cross the traffic
and head down the front steps. 
It's another beautiful day on Pennsylvania Avenue. Riley
takes it all in...and then sighs.
RILEY
So, any other family quests,
treasures that you might know about,
something else I can waste seven
years of my life with?
BEN
Nope. That was the only one.
SADUSKY (O.S.)
Gates! Poole!
They turn to find the Sadusky and his team approaching.
RILEY
What now?
SADUSKY
It seems that, well, the President's
been looking for, uh, something
else for a very long time, and he
would very much appreciate your
help in finding it.
Ben and Riley look at each other and GRIN BIG as we start
SLOWLY PULLING UP for a overhead view of the National
Archives...
RILEY
I don't know, Sadusky. How much he
paying? 'Cause the last expedition
I went on was sort of a bust.
SADUSKY
How much do you want?
As they talk, we continue PULLING UP until we have a
glorious, sky-high, panoramic view of our great nation's
capital, and we..
FADE OUT.
The End.
