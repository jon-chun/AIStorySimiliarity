To estimate the similarity between "Raiders of the Lost Ark" (1981) and "Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny" (2023), we can consider several narrative features such as beliefs, motivations, social dynamics, and arc. Here's the analysis and final similarity score based on these features:

1. **Beliefs**: The core beliefs in both films revolve around the importance of historical artifacts and the protagonist's duty to protect them from falling into the wrong hands. However, the contexts and specific artifacts differ, which influences the similarity score.

2. **Motivations**: Indiana Jones's motivation to recover and protect historical artifacts remains consistent across both films. However, the secondary characters and their motivations introduce differences. For instance, "Raiders of the Lost Ark" has Jones contending with the Nazis seeking the Ark of the Covenant, while "Dial of Destiny" involves a more complex plot with time travel elements and a different set of antagonists.

3. **Social Dynamics**: The dynamics between Indiana Jones and his allies/enemies are similar in their adventurous and combative nature, but the specific characters and their relationships vary. For example, "Raiders of the Lost Ark" features Marion Ravenwood, while "Dial of Destiny" introduces new characters like Helena Shaw.

4. **Arc**: Both films follow a classic adventure arc, with Jones embarking on a quest, facing numerous challenges, and ultimately triumphing. However, the detailed progression and the climax involving different historical artifacts provide variation.
