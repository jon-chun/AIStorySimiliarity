To compare the narratives of "The Mummy" (1999) and "Raiders of the Lost Ark" (1981), I will focus on four key features: beliefs, motivations, social dynamics, and character arcs. I'll assign a value to each feature based on a qualitative analysis of the similarities between the two scripts.

### Key Features and Scoring Rubric:

1. **Beliefs**: Refers to the underlying ideologies or philosophies held by the protagonists and other central characters.
2. **Motivations**: Examines the driving forces behind the characters' actions.
3. **Social Dynamics**: Analyzes the relationships and interactions between characters.
4. **Arc**: Looks at the development and transformation of characters throughout the story.

### Feature Analysis:

#### Feature 1: Beliefs
- **Value**: 80
- **Description**: Both films revolve around a central belief in ancient artifacts with supernatural powers.
- **Reasoning**: "The Mummy" involves belief in the power of the Book of the Dead and ancient curses, while "Raiders of the Lost Ark" centers on the Ark of the Covenant and its divine powers. Both scripts reflect a profound respect and fear for these ancient artifacts, which is central to the protagonists' and antagonists' motivations.

#### Feature 2: Motivations
- **Value**: 85
- **Description**: The primary motivations for both protagonists are driven by adventure and the pursuit of historical artifacts.
- **Reasoning**: Indiana Jones is motivated by the academic and historical significance of the Ark, as well as personal rivalries. In "The Mummy," Rick O'Connell's motivations also include adventure, but are more deeply intertwined with personal stakes and relationships, particularly with Evelyn. Both scripts emphasize the adventurous spirit and the high stakes involved in their quests.

#### Feature 3: Social Dynamics
- **Value**: 75
- **Description**: The interactions and relationships among the characters display notable similarities.
- **Reasoning**: Both films feature a dynamic duo (Indiana Jones and Marion in "Raiders," Rick O'Connell and Evelyn in "The Mummy") whose relationships develop over the course of the adventure. Additionally, both scripts include a mentor figure (Sallah in "Raiders," Jonathan in "The Mummy") and a significant antagonist who has personal conflicts with the protagonist.

#### Feature 4: Arc
- **Value**: 70
- **Description**: The character development arcs show notable parallels.
- **Reasoning**: Indiana Jones transforms from a skeptical academic to someone who respects the supernatural. Rick O'Connell evolves from a self-serving adventurer to a heroic figure who takes on greater responsibility. Both arcs involve significant personal growth and increased respect for the ancient powers they encounter.
