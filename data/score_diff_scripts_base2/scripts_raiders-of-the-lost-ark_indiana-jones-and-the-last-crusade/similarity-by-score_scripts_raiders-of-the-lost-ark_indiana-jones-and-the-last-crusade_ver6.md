To estimate the similarity between the narratives of "Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade" and "Raiders of the Lost Ark," I have broken down the analysis into four primary features: beliefs, motivations, social dynamics, and narrative arc. Here is the detailed comparison and the final similarity score:

### Feature Analysis

1. **Beliefs**
   - **Description**: The core values and worldviews held by the main characters.
   - **Analysis**: Both films showcase Indiana Jones as a character driven by a deep respect for archaeology and historical artifacts, emphasizing that such treasures belong in museums rather than in the hands of private collectors or power-seeking individuals.
   - **Score**: 90
   - **Reasoning**: The shared belief in the preservation of historical artifacts and disdain for their misuse is a central theme in both narratives.

2. **Motivations**
   - **Description**: The primary driving forces behind the characters' actions.
   - **Analysis**: In both films, Indiana Jones is motivated by a mix of personal curiosity, professional duty, and the thrill of adventure. However, in "The Last Crusade," there is an added layer of personal motivation involving his relationship with his father and the search for the Holy Grail.
   - **Score**: 85
   - **Reasoning**: While both films share similar adventure-driven motivations, "The Last Crusade" adds familial motivations that slightly differentiate it.

3. **Social Dynamics**
   - **Description**: The interactions and relationships between characters.
   - **Analysis**: Both films feature a dynamic interplay between Indiana Jones and his companions (Sallah, Marcus Brody, and Marion in "Raiders," and his father in "The Last Crusade"). The relationships are characterized by camaraderie, loyalty, and mutual respect.
   - **Score**: 80
   - **Reasoning**: Although the social dynamics are strong in both films, "The Last Crusade" focuses more on the father-son relationship, which introduces a different dynamic compared to the romantic and adventurous interactions in "Raiders."

4. **Narrative Arc**
   - **Description**: The overall structure and progression of the story.
   - **Analysis**: Both films follow a similar narrative arc involving a quest for a significant artifact, encounters with antagonists (Nazis in both cases), and a series of adventurous trials leading to a climactic resolution. However, "The Last Crusade" incorporates a more personal journey for Indiana with his father.
   - **Score**: 85
   - **Reasoning**: The narrative arcs are closely aligned, but "The Last Crusade" includes additional personal growth and resolution elements.

### Overall Similarity Score

Combining the weighted scores of the features:

- **Beliefs**: 90
- **Motivations**: 85
- **Social Dynamics**: 80
- **Narrative Arc**: 85

The overall similarity score is calculated as follows:
