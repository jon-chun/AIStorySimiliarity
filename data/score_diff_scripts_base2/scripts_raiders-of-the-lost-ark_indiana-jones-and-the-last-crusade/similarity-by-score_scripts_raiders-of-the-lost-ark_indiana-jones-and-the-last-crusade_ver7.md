Based on a thorough analysis of the provided scripts for "Raiders of the Lost Ark" and "Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade," I have created a scoring rubric to estimate the similarity score between the two narratives. The following weighted features were considered: beliefs, motivations, social dynamics, and arc.

### Similarity Analysis:

**Beliefs:**
- Both films explore the belief in historical and religious artifacts' power and significance. 
- Indy’s belief in the importance of preserving history and artifacts in museums is central to both narratives.
  
**Motivations:**
- Indy’s primary motivation in both films is driven by a mix of professional duty and personal commitment to archaeological integrity.
- Secondary characters also share similar motivations related to greed and the pursuit of power through the artifacts.

**Social Dynamics:**
- Both films feature a combination of allies and antagonists, with complex relationships and power dynamics.
- The camaraderie between Indy and his allies (e.g., Marion in "Raiders" and his father in "Last Crusade") is a recurring theme.

**Arc:**
- The narrative arc of both films follows a classic adventure structure: discovery, pursuit, confrontation, and resolution.
- Indy’s character development and his personal stakes (e.g., relationship with his father in "Last Crusade") show a deeper layer compared to "Raiders."
