To estimate a similarity score between the two Indiana Jones films, "Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade" (1989) and "Raiders of the Lost Ark" (1981), I will use a scoring rubric that considers four key narrative features: beliefs, motivations, social dynamics, and arc.

### Scoring Rubric:
1. **Beliefs**: The underlying principles or ideologies that drive the characters.
2. **Motivations**: The goals and desires that propel the characters forward.
3. **Social Dynamics**: The relationships and interactions between characters.
4. **Arc**: The overall narrative structure and progression of the story.

### Evaluation:

#### Feature 1: Beliefs
- **Value**: 85
- **Description**: Both films share a strong emphasis on archaeological and historical values.
- **Reasoning**: Indiana Jones is portrayed consistently as a character driven by a belief in preserving history and artifacts. In "Raiders of the Lost Ark," his goal is to prevent the Ark of the Covenant from falling into Nazi hands, reflecting his belief in protecting sacred relics. In "The Last Crusade," his quest for the Holy Grail is motivated by a similar belief in the significance of historical artifacts and their preservation.

#### Feature 2: Motivations
- **Value**: 90
- **Description**: The motivations of the characters are closely aligned in both films.
- **Reasoning**: In both movies, Indiana Jones is primarily motivated by the quest for historical artifacts. His motivations are both personal and professional, involving a deep-seated desire to discover and protect important historical items. "Raiders of the Lost Ark" sees him motivated by a mix of professional duty and personal rivalry with Belloq, while "The Last Crusade" adds the personal motivation of rescuing his father and fulfilling his lifelong quest.

#### Feature 3: Social Dynamics
- **Value**: 75
- **Description**: The relationships and interactions between characters show similarities but also significant differences.
- **Reasoning**: While both films feature a mix of camaraderie and conflict, the dynamics differ. "Raiders of the Lost Ark" features a romance with Marion Ravenwood and a rivalry with Belloq, whereas "The Last Crusade" focuses on the father-son relationship between Indiana and Henry Jones Sr., along with the initial antagonism and eventual partnership with Elsa Schneider. The shift from a romantic and rival dynamic to a familial and partnership dynamic is notable.

#### Feature 4: Arc
- **Value**: 80
- **Description**: The narrative structure and progression of both films are quite similar.
- **Reasoning**: Both films follow a classic adventure arc with Indiana Jones embarking on a quest, facing numerous obstacles, and ultimately achieving his goal. The structure involves a mix of action, exploration, and intellectual problem-solving. Both films start with an introductory adventure that sets the stage, followed by a series of escalating challenges leading to a climactic resolution.

### Final Similarity Score Calculation:
- Beliefs: 85 (weighted 25%)
- Motivations: 90 (weighted 25%)
- Social Dynamics: 75 (weighted 25%)
- Arc: 80 (weighted 25%)

### Overall Similarity:
The overall similarity score is calculated by taking the average of the weighted scores for each feature.

\[
\text{similarity\_overall} = \frac{(85 \times 0.25) + (90 \times 0.25) + (75 \times 0.25) + (80 \times 0.25)}{4} = 82.5
\]
