To compare the narratives of "Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade" (1989) and "Raiders of the Lost Ark" (1981), I will evaluate them based on the following weighted features: beliefs, motivations, social dynamics, and narrative arc. Each feature will be scored on a scale of 0-100, and these scores will be used to calculate an overall similarity score.

### Features and Scoring Rubric:
1. **Beliefs**: The underlying beliefs and ideologies driving the characters.
2. **Motivations**: The reasons behind the characters' actions and the central quest.
3. **Social Dynamics**: Interactions and relationships between characters.
4. **Narrative Arc**: The structure and progression of the story, including key events and resolutions.

### Evaluation:
#### 1. Beliefs:
- **Raiders of the Lost Ark**: Indiana Jones seeks the Ark of the Covenant, driven by a belief in its historical and archaeological significance, juxtaposed with the antagonists' (Nazis) belief in its supernatural power.
- **The Last Crusade**: Indiana Jones searches for the Holy Grail, motivated by its historical importance and a personal belief in his father's research, contrasting with the Nazis' pursuit of immortality and power.

Score: **85**
**Reasoning**: Both films have a strong belief in historical artifacts' significance, but the specific artifacts and their implied supernatural powers differ slightly.

#### 2. Motivations:
- **Raiders of the Lost Ark**: Indiana Jones is motivated by the desire to preserve the Ark and prevent it from falling into the wrong hands, specifically the Nazis.
- **The Last Crusade**: Indiana Jones is driven by the need to save his father and find the Holy Grail, which also involves stopping the Nazis.

Score: **90**
**Reasoning**: Both narratives center around preventing powerful artifacts from being misused by Nazis, with an additional personal motivation in "The Last Crusade."

#### 3. Social Dynamics:
- **Raiders of the Lost Ark**: Indiana Jones' interactions primarily involve Marion Ravenwood, Sallah, and the antagonists.
- **The Last Crusade**: Social dynamics are enriched by the father-son relationship between Indiana and Henry Jones Sr., along with other recurring characters like Sallah and new ones like Elsa Schneider.

Score: **80**
**Reasoning**: "The Last Crusade" adds a deeper layer of familial interaction, whereas "Raiders" focuses more on romantic and friendship dynamics.

#### 4. Narrative Arc:
- **Raiders of the Lost Ark**: The story follows a linear adventure structure with a clear beginning, middle, and end, focusing on the quest for the Ark.
- **The Last Crusade**: Similarly follows a linear adventure but includes more personal stakes and historical flashbacks, enriching the narrative structure.

Score: **85**
**Reasoning**: Both films follow a similar adventure format with a quest for an artifact but "The Last Crusade" has a more layered narrative due to personal stakes and historical context.

### Final Similarity Score Calculation:
Given the weighted features and their scores:
- Beliefs: 85
- Motivations: 90
- Social Dynamics: 80
- Narrative Arc: 85

**Overall Similarity Score**:
\[
\text{similarity\_overall} = \frac{85 + 90 + 80 + 85}{4} = 85
\]
