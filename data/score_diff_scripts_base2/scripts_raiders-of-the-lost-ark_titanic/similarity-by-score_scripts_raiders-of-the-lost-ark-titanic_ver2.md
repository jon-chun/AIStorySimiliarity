Based on the analysis of the two film scripts "Raiders of the Lost Ark" and "Titanic," I will evaluate their similarity across several narrative dimensions and provide a final overall similarity score. Here is the breakdown of the scoring:

- **Beliefs**: This feature examines the core beliefs and worldviews of the main characters.
- **Motivations**: This feature evaluates the driving forces behind the characters' actions and decisions.
- **Social Dynamics**: This feature looks at the interactions and relationships among characters.
- **Arc**: This feature assesses the overall narrative structure and character development arcs.

Let's begin with the evaluation:

### Beliefs
- **"Raiders of the Lost Ark"**: Indiana Jones believes in the importance of history and artifacts, often valuing them over his own safety. His worldview is shaped by a dedication to preserving history.
- **"Titanic"**: Rose DeWitt Bukater’s beliefs evolve from conforming to societal expectations to valuing personal freedom and love. Her journey is about breaking free from social constraints.
- **Score**: 40
  - **Reasoning**: Both films explore characters who challenge the status quo, but the contexts and outcomes are different. Indiana's beliefs are consistent throughout, while Rose's beliefs transform significantly.

### Motivations
