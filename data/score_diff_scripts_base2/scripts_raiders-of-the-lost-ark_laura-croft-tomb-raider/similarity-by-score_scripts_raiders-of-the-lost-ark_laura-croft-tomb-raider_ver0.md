Let me analyze these two film narratives step-by-step to estimate their similarity:

1. Protagonists:
Both feature strong, capable female protagonists (Lara Croft and Indiana Jones) who are adventurous archaeologists/treasure hunters. This is a key similarity.

2. Setting:
Both films involve globe-trotting adventures to exotic locations in search of ancient artifacts. The settings are quite similar.

3. Plot structure:
Both follow a similar structure of the protagonist racing against villains to find a powerful ancient artifact. The basic plot arc is very comparable.

4. Supporting characters:
Both feature mentor figures (Karak for Lara, Marcus for Indy) and romantic interests/allies met during the adventure. The character dynamics are alike.

5. Villains:
Both have ruthless, wealthy antagonists seeking the artifacts for personal gain (Malvern vs. Belloq/Nazis). The villain motivations and types align closely.

6. Action sequences: 
Both incorporate elaborate action/adventure setpieces with traps, chases, and fights. The style of action is very similar.

7. Themes:
Both explore themes of preserving history, the dangers of greed/power, and personal growth through adventure. The thematic elements overlap significantly.

8. Tone:
While both have humor, the Tomb Raider script has a slightly more serious tone overall compared to Raiders' lighter adventure feel. There's some tonal difference.

9. Character backstory:
Lara has more detailed backstory and emotional trauma explored, while Indy's past is less prominent. This is an area of difference.

10. Artifact/McGuffin:
The nature and powers of the artifacts differ - the Ark is more mystical/religious while the Black Veil is more sci-fi. This creates some narrative difference.

Based on this analysis, I'll now provide scores for key features and an overall similarity score:
