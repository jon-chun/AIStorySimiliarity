Let me analyze these two narratives step-by-step to estimate their similarity:

1. Protagonist:
Both feature strong, skilled female protagonists (Lara Croft and Indiana Jones) who are archaeologist-adventurers. This is a major similarity.

2. Setting:
Both involve globe-trotting adventures to exotic locations in search of ancient artifacts. Another strong similarity.

3. Plot structure:
Both follow a similar structure of the protagonist racing against villains to find powerful artifacts, facing traps and challenges along the way. Very similar.

4. Antagonists:
Both feature ruthless, wealthy antagonists seeking artifacts for personal gain (Malvern and Belloq). Similar motivations and dynamics.

5. Supporting characters:
Both have mentors/father figures (Karak for Lara, Marcus for Indy) and temporary allies met during adventures. Somewhat similar dynamics.

6. Artifacts:
The artifacts in both (Ark of the Covenant, Black Veil) have mystical/powerful properties. Similar concept.

7. Action sequences:
Both feature elaborate traps, chases, and fights as the protagonists navigate ancient ruins. Very similar style.

8. Tone:
While both have humor, Raiders has a slightly lighter tone overall compared to the darker elements in Tomb Raider. Some difference here.

9. Character backstory:
Lara has a more developed tragic backstory involving her parents' death, while Indy's past is less explored. Some difference.

10. Time period:
Raiders is set in the 1930s while Tomb Raider is contemporary. This affects technology and some plot elements. Notable difference.
