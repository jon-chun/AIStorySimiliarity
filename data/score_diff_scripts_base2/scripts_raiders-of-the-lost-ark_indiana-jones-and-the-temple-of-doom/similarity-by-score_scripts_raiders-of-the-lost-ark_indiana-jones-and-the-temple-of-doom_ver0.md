Based on the scripts of "Raiders of the Lost Ark" (1981) and "Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom" (1984), I have analyzed the similarity between the two narratives using four primary features: beliefs, motivations, social dynamics, and arc. Each feature has been scored, and the overall similarity score has been calculated.

### Feature Analysis and Scores

#### Feature 1: Beliefs
- **Value**: 75
- **Description**: Shared underlying beliefs and themes.
- **Reasoning**: Both films prominently feature the quest for sacred artifacts (the Ark of the Covenant and the Sankara Stones) with inherent religious and supernatural significance. The protagonists and antagonists in both narratives exhibit strong beliefs in the mystical powers of these artifacts   .

#### Feature 2: Motivations
- **Value**: 80
- **Description**: Character motivations driving the plot.
- **Reasoning**: Indiana Jones is consistently motivated by a mix of scholarly curiosity, personal ambition, and a desire to protect powerful artifacts from falling into the wrong hands. In both films, his primary motivation is to retrieve and secure these artifacts.
