2. **Motivations**: Driving forces behind the characters' actions.
3. **Social Dynamics**: Relationships and interactions between characters.
4. **Arc**: Overall narrative structure and progression.

### Feature Definitions and Reasoning

3. **Social Dynamics**: Indy's relationships with other characters vary significantly between the two films, affecting interactions and conflicts.
