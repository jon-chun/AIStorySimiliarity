    "reasoning_errors": "The overall similarity score of 56% for characters seems slightly low given the detailed breakdown. While the roles and settings are very different, there are notable similarities in character arcs, beliefs about authority, and transformations that could justify a slightly higher score. The reasoning, however, is generally sound and well-supported by the feature comparisons."
