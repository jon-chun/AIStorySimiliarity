    "reasoning_errors": "The overall similarity score (53%) seems slightly inflated given the significant differences between the films. While there are some thematic parallels in character arcs and rebellion against authority, the genres, settings, and core narratives are vastly different. The plot similarity score (63%) also appears high, as the basic structures of the stories have limited commonalities beyond broad storytelling beats."
