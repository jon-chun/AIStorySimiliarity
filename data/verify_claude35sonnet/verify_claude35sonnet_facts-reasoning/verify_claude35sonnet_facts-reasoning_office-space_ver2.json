    "reasoning_errors": "The themes similarity score of 4 seems overly low. While the main themes differ significantly, there are some underlying similarities in character motivations and rebellion against authority that warrant a slightly higher score. Additionally, the reasoning for plot similarities overemphasizes structural parallels without adequately addressing the vast differences in tone, stakes, and genre between the two films."
