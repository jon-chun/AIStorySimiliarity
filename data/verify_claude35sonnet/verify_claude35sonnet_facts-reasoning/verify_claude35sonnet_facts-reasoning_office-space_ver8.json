    "reasoning_errors": "The thematic comparison overemphasizes superficial plot similarities while undervaluing the stark tonal and genre differences between the films. The character analysis, while mostly accurate, doesn't fully capture the drastic difference in protagonist goals and motivations. The plot comparison somewhat overstates structural similarities between a high-stakes adventure and a workplace comedy."
