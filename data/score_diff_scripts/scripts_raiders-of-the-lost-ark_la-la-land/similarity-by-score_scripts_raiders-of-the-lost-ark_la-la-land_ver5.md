Thank you for the instructions. I'll carefully analyze the two film scripts and provide a similarity score based on key narrative features. I'll be sure to avoid reproducing any copyrighted material in my response. Here is my analysis in the requested JSON format:

        "reasoning": "Both films center on ambitious young artists (Mia/Indy) trying to make it in LA. They face repeated setbacks but persevere, ultimately achieving some level of success in their fields."
    },

        "description": "Nostalgic tone and reverence for the past",
