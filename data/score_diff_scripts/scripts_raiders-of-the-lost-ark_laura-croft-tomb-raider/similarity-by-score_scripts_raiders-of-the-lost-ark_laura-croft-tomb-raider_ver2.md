4. Antagonists: Both feature ruthless villains seeking powerful artifacts for nefarious purposes. Similar.

5. Supporting characters: Some differences in specific characters, but both have allies and betrayals. Moderately similar.

6. Themes: Both explore themes of legacy, family, and the ethics of artifact hunting. Quite similar.

7. Tone: Both have a mix of action, humor, and drama, though the second seems slightly darker. Mostly similar.

8. Character arc: In both, Lara grows and confronts personal demons related to her past. Very similar.

9. MacGuffin: The specific artifacts differ, but both revolve around powerful ancient objects. Moderately similar.

10. Action set-pieces: Both feature elaborate traps, chases, and fight scenes in exotic locales. Very similar.
