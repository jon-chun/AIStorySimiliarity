To estimate the similarity between these two narratives, I'll analyze key features and assign scores, then calculate an overall similarity score. Let's break it down step by step:

1. Protagonist characteristics:
Both feature strong, independent female protagonists (Lara Croft and Indiana Jones) with archaeological expertise. 
Score: 90/100

2. Plot structure:
Both follow an adventure/treasure hunt structure with multiple action sequences and puzzles.
Score: 85/100

3. Setting:
Both involve exotic locations and ancient ruins, though specific settings differ.
Score: 75/100

4. Supporting characters:
Both have mentors (Karak for Lara, Marcus for Indy) and romantic interests, but character dynamics differ.
Score: 60/100

5. Antagonists:
Both feature ruthless villains seeking powerful artifacts, though motivations differ slightly.
Score: 70/100

6. Theme:
Both explore themes of legacy, adventure, and the ethics of archaeology.
Score: 80/100

Calculating the overall similarity score:
(90 + 85 + 75 + 60 + 70 + 80) / 6 = 76.67

Rounding to the nearest integer, we get 77.

Now, I'll present this information in the requested JSON format:
