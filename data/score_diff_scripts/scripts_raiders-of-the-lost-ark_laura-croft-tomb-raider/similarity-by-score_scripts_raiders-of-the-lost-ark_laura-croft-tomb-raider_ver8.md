Let me analyze these two narratives step-by-step to estimate their similarity:

1. Protagonists: Both feature female adventurer protagonists (Lara Croft and Indiana Jones) who are highly skilled and confident. 

2. Plot structure: Both involve quests for ancient artifacts with supernatural powers.

3. Antagonists: Both have ruthless villains seeking the artifacts for nefarious purposes.

4. Setting: Both take place across exotic global locations.

5. Action sequences: Both feature elaborate action/adventure setpieces and traps.

6. Supporting characters: Both have sidekicks/allies who assist and sometimes betray the protagonist.

7. Themes: Both explore themes of legacy, discovery, and the dangers of unchecked power.

8. Tone: Both blend action, humor, and supernatural elements.

Based on this analysis, I'll score the key features and provide an overall similarity score:
