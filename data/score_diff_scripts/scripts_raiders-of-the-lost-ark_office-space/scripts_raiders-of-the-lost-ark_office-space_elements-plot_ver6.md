###COMPARISON

{
    "overall": {
        "similarity": 60,
        "reasoning": "Both scripts follow a traditional narrative structure with a clear protagonist introduction, inciting incident, rising action, climax, resolution, consequences, and final outcome. However, the thematic elements, tone, and genre differ significantly, affecting the overall similarity score."
    },
    "protagonist_introduction": {
        "similarity": 65,
        "reasoning": "Both scripts introduce their protagonists by highlighting their current situations and core traits. However, Indiana Jones is portrayed as an adventurous archaeologist, while Peter Gibbons is shown as a frustrated office worker. The settings and contexts are markedly different."
    },
    "inciting_incident": {
        "similarity": 70,
        "reasoning": "In both stories, the inciting incident disrupts the protagonist's status quo, propelling them into the main conflict. Indiana Jones is tasked with finding the Ark, while Peter Gibbons undergoes hypnotherapy, leading to significant changes in his behavior. Both incidents effectively set the stage for the narrative."
    },
    "rising_action": {
        "similarity": 60,
        "reasoning": "The rising action in both scripts involves the protagonists facing a series of challenges and developing key relationships. Indiana Jones encounters physical dangers and rivals, while Peter Gibbons deals with office politics and personal dilemmas. The nature of the challenges differs greatly."
    },
    "climax": {
        "similarity": 55,
        "reasoning": "The climaxes in both scripts feature a turning point with high tension. Indiana Jones faces the supernatural power of the Ark, while Peter Gibbons confronts the consequences of his embezzlement scheme. The stakes and resolutions differ significantly."
    },
    "resolution": {
        "similarity": 60,
        "reasoning": "Both resolutions show the protagonists dealing with the immediate outcomes of their actions. Indiana Jones secures the Ark but loses it to the government, while Peter Gibbons escapes legal consequences but faces a changed future. Both resolutions tie up the main plot but in different ways."
    },
    "consequences": {
        "similarity": 50,
        "reasoning": "The consequences in both scripts reflect the immediate effects of the climax on the protagonists. Indiana Jones deals with the Ark's secrecy, while Peter Gibbons faces the aftermath of his hypnotherapy and job situation. The nature of the consequences varies."
    },
    "final_outcome": {
        "similarity": 60,
        "reasoning": "Both scripts establish a new status quo for the protagonists. Indiana Jones returns to academia, while Peter Gibbons finds a new job in construction. Both outcomes reflect the protagonists' growth and hint at their future paths."
    },
    "loose_ends": {
        "similarity": 55,
        "reasoning": "Both narratives leave some questions unanswered. Indiana Jones's story hints at future adventures, while Peter Gibbons's ending suggests ongoing implications of his actions. These loose ends provide room for interpretation and continuation."
    },
    "subplots": {
        "similarity": 65,
        "reasoning": "Both scripts include subplots that develop secondary characters and themes. Indiana Jones has his relationships with Marion and Sallah, while Office Space explores the dynamics among Peter's coworkers. These subplots add depth to the main narrative."
