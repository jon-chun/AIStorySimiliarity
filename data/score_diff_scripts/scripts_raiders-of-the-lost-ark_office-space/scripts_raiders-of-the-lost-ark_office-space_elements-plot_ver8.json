        "similarity": 60,
        "reasoning": "While both narratives follow a similar structural arc with key elements such as a protagonist introduction, inciting incident, rising action, climax, and resolution, they diverge significantly in their themes, settings, and character arcs. 'Raiders of the Lost Ark' is an adventure story centered on a heroic archaeologist, while 'Office Space' is a satirical comedy focused on the mundane and frustrating aspects of corporate life."

    "protagonist_introduction": {
        "similarity": 50,
        "reasoning": "Both films introduce their protagonists in ways that highlight their core traits and current situations. Indiana Jones is shown as a daring archaeologist, while Peter Gibbons is portrayed as a frustrated office worker.

    },
    "inciting_incident": {
        "similarity": 55,
        "reasoning": "The inciting incidents in both films serve to disrupt the protagonists' status quo and propel them into the main conflict. In 'Raiders of the Lost Ark', Indiana Jones is tasked with finding the Ark of the Covenant before the Nazis, whereas in 'Office Space', Peter's hypnotic session leads him to adopt a radically different approach to his job. Both incidents are pivotal in starting the main narrative arc."
    },
    "rising_action": {
        "similarity": 60,
        "reasoning": "Both narratives develop through escalating challenges.

The rising actions build tension and develop the characters, albeit in very different genres and contexts."
    },
    "climax": {
        "similarity": 65,
        "reasoning": "The climaxes involve critical turning points for both protagonists. Indiana Jones faces the supernatural consequences of the Ark's power, while Peter's embezzlement scheme starts to unravel. Both climaxes are high-stakes and lead to significant consequences, though the nature of the conflicts and resolutions differ."
    },
    "resolution": {
        "similarity": 70,
        "reasoning": "The resolutions tie up the main conflicts, with Indiana securing the Ark and Peter escaping the consequences of his actions to some extent. Both films resolve the immediate narrative tension and provide a sense of closure, although 'Raiders' ends on a more triumphant note compared to the more subdued conclusion of 'Office Space'."
    },
    "consequences": {
        "similarity": 60,
        "reasoning": "The consequences show the aftermath of the protagonists' actions. Indiana deals with the Ark being stored away, and Peter faces the dissolution of his plan and the impact on his work life. Both films explore the short-term effects of the climax on the characters, reflecting their growth and changes."
    },
    "final_outcome": {
        "similarity": 65,
        "reasoning": "Both films establish a new status quo for the protagonists.

The final outcomes reflect significant changes in their lives and hint at future possibilities."
    },
    "loose_ends": {
        "similarity": 50,
        "reasoning": "Both films leave some questions unanswered. 'Raiders of the Lost Ark' hints at future adventures for Indiana Jones, while 'Office Space' leaves open the characters' futures and the ultimate fate of Initech. These loose ends add depth and potential for future stories."
    },
    "subplots": {
        "similarity": 55,
        "reasoning": "Both narratives are enriched by subplots that develop supporting characters and themes. 'Raiders of the Lost Ark' includes Indiana's relationships and rivalries, while 'Office Space' explores the dynamics among Peter's coworkers and their individual frustrations. These subplots add layers to the main story."
