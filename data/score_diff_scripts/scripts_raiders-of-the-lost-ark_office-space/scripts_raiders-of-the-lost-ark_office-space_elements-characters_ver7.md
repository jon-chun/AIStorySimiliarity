        "reasoning": "Peter Gibbons and Indiana Jones are fundamentally different characters. Peter is a frustrated office worker who becomes disillusioned with his job and seeks freedom from corporate drudgery. Indiana Jones is an adventurous archaeologist who seeks to uncover historical artifacts while facing physical dangers. Their motivations, environments, and personalities are quite distinct."

    "backstory": {
        "similarity": 25,
        "reasoning": "Peter's backstory revolves around his mundane life in a corporate setting, struggling with his dissatisfaction at work. Indiana's backstory is rich with adventure, academic pursuits, and previous archaeological expeditions. The contexts of their lives are vastly different."

    "strengths": {
        "similarity": 40,
        "reasoning": "Peter's strengths lie in his eventual courage to defy his oppressive work environment and his technical skills.

    },
    "weakness": {
        "similarity": 50,
        "reasoning": "Both characters have weaknesses that revolve around their main environments. Peter's apathy and lack of direction are his primary weaknesses, while Indiana's overconfidence and risk-taking behavior are his vulnerabilities. Both characters face internal struggles that affect their decisions."

        "similarity": 45,
        "reasoning": "Both characters interact with a variety of supporting characters. Peter deals with coworkers, friends, and romantic interests in a corporate environment.

        "similarity": 40,
