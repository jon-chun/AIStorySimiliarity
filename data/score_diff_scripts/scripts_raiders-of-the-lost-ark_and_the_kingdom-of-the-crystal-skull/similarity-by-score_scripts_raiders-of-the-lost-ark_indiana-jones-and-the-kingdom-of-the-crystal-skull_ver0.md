To estimate a similarity score between "Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull" (2008) and "Raiders of the Lost Ark" (1981), we need to compare various narrative features. These features can include beliefs, motivations, social dynamics, and the narrative arc. Here is a structured comparison and a final similarity score:

### Feature 1: Beliefs
**Value**: 70
**Description**: The core belief in both films revolves around the pursuit of powerful artifacts with supernatural elements.
**Reasoning**: In "Raiders of the Lost Ark," Indiana Jones seeks the Ark of the Covenant, which is believed to hold immense divine power. Similarly, in "Kingdom of the Crystal Skull," he searches for a crystal skull with alien origins that also possesses otherworldly powers. Both artifacts require a deep belief in their mythical properties and historical significance, creating a shared thematic element between the films.

### Feature 2: Motivations
**Value**: 80
**Description**: The primary motivation in both films is driven by the quest for historical and powerful artifacts.
**Reasoning**: Indiana Jones' motivation in both narratives is rooted in his archeological pursuits and the desire to prevent powerful artifacts from falling into the wrong hands. In "Raiders of the Lost Ark," he aims to secure the Ark to prevent the Nazis from using its power. In "Kingdom of the Crystal Skull," he is similarly motivated to find the skull before the Soviets can exploit its potential. Both films depict Jones' dedication to preserving history and combating evil forces.

### Feature 3: Social Dynamics

In "Kingdom of the Crystal Skull," he partners with his former lover Marion, his son Mutt, and faces Soviet agent Irina Spalko. Although the dynamics of trust and betrayal are present in both, the specific relationships and character developments differ significantly.

### Feature 4: Arc
**Value**: 75
**Description**: The narrative arc follows a similar trajectory of discovery, conflict, and resolution.
**Reasoning**: Both films follow a classic adventure arc where Indiana Jones embarks on a quest, faces numerous challenges, confronts the main antagonists, and ultimately resolves the conflict surrounding the artifact. In "Raiders of the Lost Ark," the arc concludes with the Ark's power defeating the Nazis, while in "Kingdom of the Crystal Skull," the skull's power results in the demise of the Soviet antagonist. The structural similarity in the journey and resolution contributes to a higher similarity score.

### Final Similarity Score Calculation
Based on the weighted features, we can calculate the overall similarity score:

- **Beliefs**: 70

Rounding to the nearest integer gives a final score of 71.
