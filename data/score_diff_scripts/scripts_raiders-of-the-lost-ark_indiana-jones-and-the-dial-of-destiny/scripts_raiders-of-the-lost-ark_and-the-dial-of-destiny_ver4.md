To estimate the similarity score between the two Indiana Jones narratives, I will assess the following features: beliefs, motivations, social dynamics, and narrative arc. Here's the scoring rubric for each feature and the overall similarity score based on the provided scripts:

1. **Beliefs**:
   - Description: The core values and ideologies held by the characters, particularly Indiana Jones.
   - Reasoning: Both narratives involve Indiana Jones, whose core belief in the importance of preserving historical artifacts for humanity remains consistent. The narratives also emphasize the ideological conflict between Jones and his adversaries (Nazis).
   - Value: 85

2. **Motivations**:
   - Description: The driving forces behind the characters' actions and decisions.
   - Reasoning: In both stories, Jones is motivated by a desire to protect significant historical artifacts from falling into the wrong hands, especially those of the Nazis. This central motivation is pivotal to both plots.
   - Value: 90

3. **Social Dynamics**:
   - Description: The interactions and relationships between the characters.
   - Reasoning: The dynamic between Indiana Jones and his allies, as well as his antagonists, shows considerable similarity. Both stories feature a close ally (e.g., Sallah in "Raiders of the Lost Ark" and Basil Shaw in "Dial of Destiny") and a strong Nazi adversary.
   - Value: 80

4. **Arc**:
   - Description: The narrative structure, including the progression of the plot and character development.
   - Reasoning: Both films follow a classic adventure arc, beginning with the discovery of an artifact and ending with a climactic confrontation and resolution. The character development of Indiana Jones remains consistent as a hero who evolves through his encounters.
   - Value: 85
