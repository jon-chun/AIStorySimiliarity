To estimate the similarity score between "Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade" and "Raiders of the Lost Ark," I will use a scoring rubric based on weighted features: beliefs, motivations, social dynamics, and arc. Here is the step-by-step estimation and the final similarity score.

### Step-by-Step Estimation

1. **Beliefs**:
   - **Raiders of the Lost Ark**: Indiana Jones is motivated by a strong belief in preserving historical artifacts for academic purposes, leading him to find the Ark of the Covenant.
   - **The Last Crusade**: Indiana Jones is similarly motivated by his belief in the significance of historical artifacts, specifically the Holy Grail, and the importance of family legacy.

   **Score**: 85 - Both films emphasize Indiana's dedication to historical preservation and his personal beliefs about the importance of artifacts.

2. **Motivations**:
   - **Raiders of the Lost Ark**: Indiana is driven by his passion for archaeology, academic integrity, and a rivalry with Belloq.
   - **The Last Crusade**: Indiana's motivations include the rescue of his father, family legacy, and the search for the Holy Grail.

   **Score**: 80 - While motivations in both films revolve around archaeology and historical preservation, "The Last Crusade" adds a significant personal motivation (rescue of his father).

3. **Social Dynamics**:
   - **Raiders of the Lost Ark**: Focuses on Indiana's relationships with Marion Ravenwood and his rivalry with Belloq.
   - **The Last Crusade**: Highlights the dynamic between Indiana and his father, alongside his interactions with Dr. Elsa Schneider and the villain Donovan.

   **Score**: 75 - Both films feature rich social dynamics, but "The Last Crusade" adds depth with the father-son relationship.

4. **Arc**:
   - **Raiders of the Lost Ark**: Follows a traditional hero’s journey with Indiana overcoming various obstacles to secure the Ark.
   - **The Last Crusade**: Also follows a hero’s journey but integrates a more personal growth aspect as Indiana reconciles with his father.

   **Score**: 90 - Both narratives follow a similar adventure arc, with "The Last Crusade" adding a significant personal growth element.

### Final Similarity Score

Based on the weighted features, the similarity between the two narratives is calculated as follows:

- Beliefs: 25%
- Motivations: 25%
- Social Dynamics: 25%
- Arc: 25%

Using these weights, the final similarity score is:

\[ \text{similarity\_overall} = (0.25 \times 85) + (0.25 \times 80) + (0.25 \times 75) + (0.25 \times 90) = 82.5 \]

Rounding to the nearest whole number:

\[ \text{similarity\_overall} = 83 \]
