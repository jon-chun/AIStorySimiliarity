    },
    "inciting_incident": {
        "similarity": 85,
        "reasoning": "In both films, the inciting incident involves Indiana Jones receiving information about a significant archaeological artifact, propelling him into the main conflict.

    },
    "rising_action": {
        "similarity": 80,
        "reasoning": "Both films feature a series of escalating challenges as Indiana Jones pursues his goal, encountering numerous obstacles and developing key relationships.

        "similarity": 75,
        "reasoning": "The climaxes in both films involve intense confrontations and critical decisions by Indiana Jones.

        "similarity": 70,
        "reasoning": "Both resolutions show Indiana Jones achieving a form of victory but dealing with the consequences of his actions.

The resolutions tie up the main plots but leave some elements open."
    },
    "consequences": {
        "similarity": 65,
        "reasoning": "The immediate aftermath in both films reflects the climax's outcomes, with Indiana Jones coping with the consequences of the artifact's fate. 'Raiders' ends with the Ark being hidden away, while 'Last Crusade' shows the implications of the Grail's loss and the characters' personal growth."
    },
    "final_outcome": {
        "similarity": 70,
        "reasoning": "Both final outcomes establish a new status quo for Indiana Jones. In 'Raiders,' he returns to his academic life, whereas in 'Last Crusade,' he reconciles with his father, showcasing personal growth. Both endings reflect the protagonist's journey and hint at future adventures."
    },
    "loose_ends": {
        "similarity": 60,
        "reasoning": "Both films leave some questions unanswered, suggesting ongoing mysteries and potential future stories. 'Raiders' hints at the hidden powers of the Ark, while 'Last Crusade' leaves open the broader implications of the Grail's existence. These loose ends enhance the adventurous spirit of the series."
    },
    "subplots": {
        "similarity": 75,
        "reasoning": "Both narratives include enriching subplots that develop secondary characters and themes. 'Raiders' features Indiana's relationships with Marion and Belloq, while 'Last Crusade' explores his relationship with his father. These subplots add depth and complexity to the main narrative."
    },
    "overall": {
        "similarity": 75,
        "reasoning": "Both films follow a similar narrative structure with distinct but related adventures for Indiana Jones. They share a cohesive progression from introduction to resolution, involving high-stakes archaeology, personal growth, and unresolved mysteries. The thematic elements and character dynamics show strong parallels, reflecting the franchise's consistent storytelling approach."
