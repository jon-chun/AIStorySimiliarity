        "description": "This feature examines the core beliefs and themes that drive the main characters.",
        "reasoning": "Both films center around Indiana Jones' quest for significant historical and religious artifacts, deeply rooted in myth and legend. In 'Raiders of the Lost Ark,' the focus is on the Ark of the Covenant, believed to hold immense power, while in 'The Last Crusade,' the search is for the Holy Grail, symbolizing eternal life. Both artifacts carry significant religious connotations, and the protagonists' beliefs about these artifacts' importance drive their actions throughout the narratives."

        "description": "This feature looks at the underlying motivations of the main characters.",
        "reasoning": "Indiana Jones' motivations in both films are driven by a mix of scholarly curiosity, the thrill of adventure, and a personal moral code. In 'Raiders of the Lost Ark,' Indy is motivated to find the Ark to prevent its power from being used by the Nazis. In 'The Last Crusade,' his quest is more personal, driven by the need to rescue his father and complete his father's lifelong quest for the Holy Grail. Both motivations align in terms of personal stakes and a larger mission to protect powerful artifacts from falling into the wrong hands."

        "reasoning": "The social dynamics in both films involve Indiana Jones working with and against various allies and antagonists. In 'Raiders of the Lost Ark,' Indy teams up with Marion Ravenwood and encounters various adversaries, including Nazi agents.

Both films depict a mix of camaraderie, betrayal, and teamwork, although 'The Last Crusade' emphasizes the father-son relationship more heavily."

        "value": 70,
        "description": "This feature examines the overall narrative structure and character development.",
        "reasoning": "Both films follow a similar narrative arc of discovery, conflict, and resolution. Indiana Jones starts with a mission, faces numerous challenges, uncovers deeper layers of the myth surrounding the artifact, and ultimately resolves the central conflict, often in a climactic showdown. 'Raiders of the Lost Ark' focuses more on action and the global implications of the Ark's power, while 'The Last Crusade' intertwines the quest with personal growth and the resolution of familial bonds. Despite these differences, the fundamental arc of adventure and discovery remains consistent."
