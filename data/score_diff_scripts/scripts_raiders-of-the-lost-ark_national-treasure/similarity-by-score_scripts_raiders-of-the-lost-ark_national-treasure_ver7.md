To estimate the similarity between the narratives of "Raiders of the Lost Ark" (1981) and "National Treasure" (2004), we will use a scoring rubric that evaluates the following features:

1. **Beliefs**
2. **Motivations**
3. **Social Dynamics**
4. **Narrative Arc**

Each feature will be assigned a value between 0 and 100, with a description and reasoning for the given score. The final similarity score will be calculated as an average of these values.

Let's start the comparison:

### 1. Beliefs
**Value**: 75
**Description**: The core belief in both narratives revolves around the idea of hidden treasures and ancient artifacts holding significant historical and cultural value.
**Reasoning**: Both Indiana Jones and Ben Gates believe in the historical importance of their quests. While Indy's quest is driven by archeological significance, Ben's quest in "National Treasure" is driven by a belief in hidden national secrets. The belief in the extraordinary value of these artifacts is a strong parallel between the two films.

### 2. Motivations
**Value**: 80
**Description**: The protagonists are motivated by a mix of personal ambition, academic interest, and the desire to protect historical treasures.
**Reasoning**: Indiana Jones is motivated by his role as an archaeologist and a desire to keep powerful artifacts out of the wrong hands. Ben Gates is driven by his family's legacy and the challenge of solving historical mysteries. Both characters exhibit a strong sense of adventure and a commitment to preserving history.

### 3. Social Dynamics
**Value**: 65
**Description**: The interactions among characters, including trust, betrayal, and collaboration, are pivotal in advancing the plot.
**Reasoning**: In "Raiders of the Lost Ark," Indy deals with betrayal from his peers and adversaries, while also collaborating with allies like Marion and Sallah. Similarly, in "National Treasure," Ben experiences both betrayal and cooperation, notably with characters like Abigail and Riley. While the dynamics are similar, the nature of the relationships differs slightly, with "National Treasure" having a more modern, ensemble feel.

### 4. Narrative Arc
**Value**: 70
**Description**: Both stories follow a classic adventure arc with a clear beginning, middle, and end, involving a quest for a significant artifact.
**Reasoning**: "Raiders of the Lost Ark" and "National Treasure" both follow a treasure hunt narrative structure. The protagonists face various obstacles, solve puzzles, and confront villains before achieving their goal. The arcs involve significant historical backdrops, with a mix of action and intellectual problem-solving. The pacing and style of storytelling are quite similar, though "Raiders of the Lost Ark" has a slightly more traditional adventure tone compared to the modern approach of "National Treasure."
