Based on a detailed analysis of the narratives of "Raiders of the Lost Ark" and "National Treasure," I will use the following features to evaluate the similarity between the two films: 

1. **Beliefs**: The core philosophical or ideological principles guiding the protagonists.
2. **Motivations**: The driving forces behind the characters' actions.
3. **Social Dynamics**: The relationships and interactions among the characters.
4. **Arc**: The development and transformation of the characters and story over time.

Here is the detailed similarity evaluation:

### Feature 1: Beliefs
- **Value**: 75
- **Description**: Core philosophical or ideological principles guiding the protagonists.
- **Reasoning**: Both protagonists, Indiana Jones and Benjamin Gates, are driven by a belief in the importance of historical artifacts and knowledge. Indiana Jones seeks to preserve history for academic purposes, while Benjamin Gates aims to uncover historical truths that can reshape understanding of American history. Their actions are guided by a respect for history and a desire to protect it from being lost or misused.

### Feature 2: Motivations
- **Value**: 80
- **Description**: The driving forces behind the characters' actions.
- **Reasoning**: Both films feature protagonists motivated by a quest for significant historical artifacts. Indiana Jones seeks the Ark of the Covenant to prevent it from falling into Nazi hands, driven by a sense of duty and preservation. Benjamin Gates is motivated by a family legacy and the intellectual challenge of finding the treasure hidden by the Founding Fathers. Both characters are propelled by a mixture of personal stakes and broader historical implications.

### Feature 3: Social Dynamics
- **Value**: 70
- **Description**: Relationships and interactions among the characters.
- **Reasoning**: Both narratives involve a mix of collaboration and conflict among characters. Indiana Jones works with colleagues and faces betrayal, while Benjamin Gates collaborates with friends and faces opposition from a former ally. The dynamics involve trust, deception, and varying degrees of camaraderie. However, "National Treasure" places more emphasis on teamwork and familial bonds compared to the more solitary and professional relationships in "Raiders of the Lost Ark."

### Feature 4: Arc
- **Value**: 65
- **Description**: Development and transformation of the characters and story over time.
- **Reasoning**: Both films follow a classic adventure arc, with the protagonists undergoing significant personal growth and facing escalating challenges. Indiana Jones transitions from a skeptical archaeologist to a believer in the supernatural power of the Ark. Benjamin Gates evolves from a treasure hunter to a hero who validates his family’s legacy. While their arcs are similar, the tone and specific challenges differ, with "Raiders of the Lost Ark" having a darker, more suspenseful progression compared to the lighter, puzzle-driven narrative of "National Treasure."
