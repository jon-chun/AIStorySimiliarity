## Abstract
Stories are central for interpreting experiences, communicating, and influencing each other across domains like film, medicine, media, and more. Quantifying story similarity has numerous applications, including detecting IP infringement, identifying hallucinations, improving search/recommendation engines, and guiding human-AI collaborations. Traditional NLP similarity metrics are often limited, using short-text distance metrics like n-gram overlaps or embeddings, which can lose significant information when applied to long texts.

This paper introduces **AIStorySimilarity**, a novel benchmark for measuring semantic distance between long-text stories using narrative theory and scriptwriting fundamentals. We base our method on four core narrative elements—**characters, plot, setting, and themes**—and 31 sub-features within these categories. Using a state-of-the-art LLM (GPT-3.5-turbo), we extract and evaluate semantic similarity for a diverse set of Hollywood films.

Our approach compares three methods: evaluating extracted elements from film scripts (**Elements**), directly evaluating entire scripts (**Scripts**), and extracting elements from the parametric memory of a state-of-the-art LLM without provided scripts (**GenAI**). To our knowledge, **AIStorySimilarity** is the first benchmark to measure story similarity over long texts comprehensively grounded in narrative theory.
